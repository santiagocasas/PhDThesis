  Abstract                 = {We investigate the interpolation of power spectra of matter fluctuations using Artificial Neural Network (PkANN). We present a new approach to confront small-scale non-linearities in the power spectrum of matter fluctuations. This ever-present and pernicious uncertainty is often the Achilles' heel in cosmological studies and must be reduced if we are to see the advent of precision cosmology in the late-time Universe. We show that an optimally trained artificial neural network (ANN), when presented with a set of cosmological parameters (Omega\_m hˆ2, Omega\_b hˆ2, n\_s, w\_0, sigma\_8, m\_nu and redshift z), can provide a worst-case error {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextless=1 per cent (for z{\textbackslash}textbackslashtextless=2) fit to the non-linear matter power spectrum deduced through N-body simulations, for modes up to k{\textbackslash}textbackslashtextless=0.7 h/Mpc. Our power spectrum interpolator is accurate over the entire parameter space. This is a significant improvement over some of the current matter power spectrum calculators. In this paper, we detail how an accurate interpolation of the matter power spectrum is achievable with only a sparsely sampled grid of cosmological parameters. Unlike large-scale N-body simulations which are computationally expensive and/or infeasible, a well-trained ANN can be an extremely quick and reliable tool in interpreting cosmological observations and parameter estimation. This paper is the first in a series. In this method paper, we generate the non-linear matter power spectra using HaloFit and use them as mock observations to train the ANN. This work sets the foundation for Paper II, where a suite of N-body simulations will be used to compute the non-linear matter power spectra at sub-per cent accuracy, in the quasi-non-linear regime 0.1 h/Mpc {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextless= k {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextless= 0.9 h/Mpc. A trained ANN based on this N-body suite will be released for the scientific community.},

The test involves the evaluation of the ratio between the differences in the redshifts of an expanding spherically symmetric distribution of radiation-emitting objects and the product of their distance with the angular radius of their distribution on the sky assuming a homogeneous, isotropic cosmology described by the Robertson-Walker metric. In the case where the cosmological constant is not equal to zero, this ratio is shown to vary significantly with a change in object distance and other parameters. Difficulties associated with the peculiar velocities and clustering of galaxies, the presumable test objects, are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The next generation of surveys will greatly improve our knowledge of cosmological gravity. In this paper we focus on how Stage IV photometric redshift surveys, including weak lensing and multiple tracers of the matter distribution and radio experiments combined with measurements of the cosmic microwave background will lead to precision constraints on deviations from General Relativity. We use a broad subclass of Horndeski scalar-tensor theories to forecast the accuracy with which we will be able to determine these deviations and their degeneracies with other cosmological parameters. Our analysis includes relativistic effects, does not rely on the quasi-static evolution and makes conservative assumptions about the effect of screening on small scales. We define a figure of merit for cosmological tests of gravity and show how the combination of different types of surveys, probing different length scales and redshifts, can be used to pin down constraints on the gravitational physics to better than a few percent, roughly an order of magnitude better than present probes. Future cosmological experiments will be able to constrain the Brans-Dicke parameter at a level comparable to Solar System and astrophysical tests.},

  Abstract                 = {A new component of the cosmic medium, a light scalar field or “quintessence,” has been proposed recently to explain cosmic acceleration with a dynamical cosmological constant. Such a field is expected to be coupled explicitly to ordinary matter, unless some unknown symmetry prevents it. I investigate the cosmological consequences of a coupled quintessence (CQ) model, assuming an exponential potential and a linear coupling. This model is conformally equivalent to Brans-Dicke Lagrangians with any power-law potential. I evaluate the density perturbations on the cosmic microwave background and on the galaxy distribution at the present and derive bounds on the coupling constant from the comparison with observational data. A novel feature of CQ is that during the matter dominated era the scalar field has a finite and almost constant energy density. This epoch, denoted as φMDE, is a saddle point in the dynamical phase space. The φMDE is responsible of several differences with respect to uncoupled quintessence: the multipole spectrum of the microwave background is tilted at large angles, the acoustic peaks are shifted, their amplitude is changed, and the present 8 Mpc/h density variance is diminished. The present data constrain the dimensionless coupling constant to {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbarβ{\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbar{\textbackslash}textbackslashtextless{\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde0.1 assuming Ωm=0.3 and a primordial fluctuation slope ns=1.},

It is however important to use a fully model-independent approach when measuring η to avoid introducing a theoretical bias into the results. In this paper we forecast the precision with which future large surveys can determine η in a way that only relies on directly observable quantities. In particular, we do not assume anything concerning the initial spectrum of perturbations, nor on its evolution outside the observed redshift range, nor on the galaxy bias. We first leave η free to vary in space and time and then we model it as suggested in Horndeski models of dark energy. Among our results, we find that a future large scale lensing and clustering survey can constrain η to within 10\% if k-independent, and to within 60\% or better at k =0.1 h/Mpc if it is restricted to follow the Horndeski model.},

(2) Are these observables sufficient to rule out not just a particular dark energy model, but the entire general class of viable models comprising a single scalar field? This paper bears both good and bad news. On one hand, we find that the goal of reconstructing dark energy models is fundamentally limited by the unobservability of the present values of the matter density Ωm0, the perturbation normalization σ8 as well as the present matter power spectrum. On the other, we find that, under certain conditions, cosmological observations can nonetheless rule out the entire class of the most general single scalar-field models, i.e., those based on the Horndeski Lagrangian.},

  Abstract                 = {Euclid is a European Space Agency medium class mission selected for launch in 2019 within the Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 programme. The main goal of Euclid is to understand the origin of the accelerated expansion of the Universe. Euclid will explore the expansion history of the Universe and the evolution of cosmic structures by measuring shapes and redshifts of galaxies as well as the distribution of clusters of galaxies over a large fraction of the sky. Although the main driver for Euclid is the nature of dark energy, Euclid science covers a vast range of topics, from cosmology to galaxy evolution to planetary research. In this review we focus on cosmology and fundamental physics, with a strong emphasis on science beyond the current standard models. We discuss five broad topics: dark energy and modified gravity, dark matter, initial conditions, basic assumptions and questions of methodology in the data analysis. This review has been planned and carried out within Euclid's Theory Working Group and is meant to provide a guide to the scientific themes that will underlie the activity of the group during the preparation of the Euclid mission.},

  Abstract                 = {We discuss the constraints that future photometric and spectroscopic redshift surveys can put on dark energy through the baryon oscillations of the power spectrum. We model the dark energy either with a perfect fluid or a scalar field and take into account the information contained in the linear growth function. We show that the growth function helps to break the degeneracy in the dark energy parameters and reduce the errors on \$w\_0,w\_1\$ roughly by 30\% making more appealing multicolor surveys based on photometric redshifts. We find that a 200 square degrees spectroscopic survey reaching \$z = 3\$ can constrain \$w\_0,w\_1\$ to within \${\textbackslash}textbackslashDelta w\_0=0.21,{\textbackslash}textbackslashDelta w\_1=0.26\$ and to \${\textbackslash}textbackslashDelta w\_0=0.39,{\textbackslash}textbackslashDelta w\_1=0.54\$ using photometric redshifts with absolute uncertainty of 0.02. In the scalar field case we show that the slope \$n\$ of the inverse power-law potential for dark energy can be constrained to \${\textbackslash}textbackslashDelta n=0.26\$ (spectroscopic redshifts) or \${\textbackslash}textbackslashDelta n=0.40\$ (photometric redshifts), i.e. better than with future ground-based supernovae surveys or CMB data.},

  Abstract                 = {The Fisher matrix is a widely used tool to forecast the performance of 
future experiments and approximate the likelihood of large data sets.
Most of the forecasts for cosmological parameters in galaxy clustering
studies rely on the Fisher matrix approach for large-scale experiments
like DES, Euclid, or SKA. Here we improve upon the standard method by
taking into account three effects: the finite window function, the
correlation between redshift bins, and the uncertainty on the bin
redshift. The first two effects are negligible only in the limit of
infinite surveys. The third effect, on the contrary, is negligible for
infinitely small bins. Here we show how to take into account these
effects and what the impact on forecasts of a Euclid-type experiment
will be. The main result of this article is that the windowing and the
bin cross-correlation induce a considerable change in the forecasted
errors, of the order of 10-30\% for most cosmological parameters, while
the redshift bin uncertainty can be neglected for bins smaller than
\${\textbackslash}Delta z = 0.1\$ roughly.},

If a modified gravity theory is responsible for cosmic acceleration, the Hubble scale is a natural regime for deviations from General Relativity (GR) to become manifest. The majority of studies to date have concentrated on the consequences of alternative gravity theories for the subhorizon, quasi-static regime, however. In this paper we investigate how modifications to the gravitational field equations affect perturbations around the Hubble scale. We choose functional forms to represent the generic scale-dependent behaviour of gravity theories that modify GR at long wavelengths, and study the resulting deviations of ultra large-scale relativistic observables from their GR behaviour. We find that these are small unless modifications to the field equations are drastic. The angular dependence and redshift evolution of the deviations is highly parameterisation- and survey-dependent, however, and so they are possibly a rich source of modified gravity phenomenology if they can be measured.},

With respect to previous works, our simulations considerably extend the statistical significance of the simulated volume and cover a wider range of different realizations of the interacting DE scenario, including the recently proposed bouncing coupled DE model. Furthermore, all the simulations are normalized in order to be consistent with the present bounds on the amplitude of density perturbations at last scattering, thereby providing the first realistic determination of the effects of a DE coupling for cosmological growth histories fully compatible with the latest cosmic microwave background data. As a first basic analysis, we have studied the impact of the coupling on the non-linear matter power spectrum and on the bias between the CDM and baryon distributions, as a function of redshift and scale. For the former, we have addressed the issue of the degeneracy between the effects of the coupling and other standard cosmological parameters, e.g. σ8, showing how the redshift evolution of the linear amplitude or the scale dependence of the non-linear power spectrum might provide a way to break the degeneracy. For the latter, instead, we have computed the redshift and scale dependence of the bias in all our different models showing how a growing coupling or a bouncing coupled DE scenario provides much stronger effects with respect to constant coupling models. Furthermore, we discuss the main features imprinted by the DE interactions on the halo and subhalo mass functions. We refer to this vast numerical initiative as the COupled Dark Energy Cosmological Simulations (codecs) project, and release all the codecs outputs for public use through a dedicated web data base, providing information on how to access and interpret the data.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a detailed numerical study of the impact that cosmological models featuring a direct interaction between the dark energy component that drives the accelerated expansion of the Universe and cold dark matter can have on the linear and non-linear stages of structure formation. By means of a series of collisionless N-body simulations, we study the influence that each of the different effects characterizing these cosmological models – which include among others a fifth force, a time variation of particle masses and a velocity-dependent acceleration – separately have on the growth of density perturbations and on a series of observable quantities related to linear and non-linear cosmic structures, as the matter power spectrum, the gravitational bias between baryons and cold dark matter, the halo mass function and the halo density profiles. We perform our analysis applying and comparing different numerical approaches previously adopted in the literature, and we address the partial discrepancies recently claimed in a similar study by Li \& Barrow with respect to the first outcomes of Baldi et al., which are found to be related to the specific numerical approach adopted in the former work. Our results fully confirm the conclusions of Baldi et al. and show that when linear and non-linear effects of the interaction between dark energy and cold dark matter are properly disentangled, the velocity-dependent acceleration is the leading effect acting at non-linear scales and in particular is the most important mechanism in lowering the concentration of cold dark matter haloes.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been proposed that the cosmological constant \{LAMBDA\} might be measured from geometric effects on large-scale structure. A positive vacuum density leads to correlation function contours which are squashed in the radial direction when calculated assuming a matter-dominated model. We show that this effect will be somewhat harder to detect than previous calculations have suggested: the squashing factor is likely to be {\textbackslash}textless 1.3, given realistic constraints on the matter contribution to \{OMEGA\}. Moreover, the geometrical distortion risks being confused with the redshift-space distortions caused by the peculiar velocities associated with the growth of galaxy clustering. These depend on the density and bias parameters via the combination β = \{OMEGA\}ˆ0.6/b, and we show that the main practical effect of a geometrical flattening factor F is to simulate gravitational instability with B\_eff\_ {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 0.5(F - 1). Nevertheless, with datasets of sufficient size it is possible to distinguish the two effects, We discuss in detail how this should be done, and give a maximum-likelihood method for extracting \{LAMBDA\} and βb from anisotropic power-spectrum data. New-generation redshift surveys of galaxies and quasars are potentially capable of detecting a non-zero vacuum density, if it exists at a cosmologically interesting level.},

  Abstract                 = {In earlier work, we have developed a Kinetic Field Theory (KFT) for cosmological structure formation and showed that the non-linear density-fluctuation power spectrum known from numerical simulations can be reproduced quite well even if particle interactions are taken into account to first order only. Besides approximating gravitational interactions, we had to truncate the initial correlation hierarchy of particle momenta at the second order. Here, we substantially simplify KFT. We show that its central object, the free generating functional, can be factorized, taking the full hierarchy of momentum correlations into account. The factors appearing in the generating functional have a universal form and can thus be tabulated for fast access in perturbation schemes. Our results show that the complete hierarchy of initial momentum correlations is responsible for a characteristic deformation in the density-fluctuation power spectrum, caused by mode transport independent of the particle interaction. At the present epoch and on scales near \$1{\textbackslash}textbackslash,hˆ\{-1\}{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{Mpc\}\$, the initial momentum correlations can almost double the linearly evolved power. We further develop perturbation theory based on the factorization of the generating functional and propose a diagrammatic scheme for the perturbation terms.},

  Abstract                 = {The universe is smooth on large scales but very inhomogeneous on small scales. Why is the spacetime on large scales modeled to a good approximation by the Friedmann equations? Are we sure that small-scale non-linearities do not induce a large backreaction? Related to this, what is the effective theory that describes the universe on large scales? In this paper we make progress in addressing these questions. We show that the effective theory for the long-wavelength universe behaves as a viscous fluid coupled to gravity: integrating out short-wavelength perturbations renormalizes the homogeneous background and introduces dissipative dynamics into the evolution of long-wavelength perturbations. The effective fluid has small perturbations and is characterized by a few parameters like an equation of state, a sound speed and a viscosity parameter. These parameters can be matched to numerical simulations or fitted from observations. We find that the backreaction of small-scale non-linearities is very small, being suppressed by the large hierarchy between the scale of non-linearities and the horizon scale. The effective pressure of the fluid is always positive and much too small to significantly affect the background evolution. Moreover, we prove that virialized scales decouple completely from the large-scale dynamics, at all orders in the post-Newtonian expansion. We propose that our effective theory be used to formulate a well-defined and controlled alternative to conventional perturbation theory, and we discuss possible observational applications. Finally, our way of reformulating results in second-order perturbation theory in terms of a long-wavelength effective fluid provides the opportunity to understand non-linear effects in a simple and physically intuitive way.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent anomalies found in cosmological datasets such as the low multipoles of the Cosmic Microwave Background or the low redshift amplitude and growth of clustering measured by e.g., abundance of galaxy clusters and redshift space distortions in galaxy surveys, have motivated explorations of models beyond standard \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM. Of particular interest are models where general relativity (GR) is modified on large cosmological scales. Here we consider deviations from \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM+GR within the context of Horndeski gravity, which is the most general theory of gravity with second derivatives in the equations of motion. We adopt a parametrization in which the four additional Horndeski functions of time \${\textbackslash}alpha\_i(t)\$ are proportional to the cosmological density of dark energy \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{DE\}(t)\$. Constraints on this extended parameter space using a suite of state-of-the art cosmological observations are presented for the first time. Although the theory is able to accommodate the low multipoles of the Cosmic Microwave Background and the low amplitude of fluctuations from redshift space distortions, we find no significant tension with \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM+GR when performing a global fit to recent cosmological data and thus there is no evidence against \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM+GR from an analysis of the value of the Bayesian evidence ratio of the modified gravity models with respect to \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM, despite introducing extra parameters. The posterior distribution of these extra parameters that we derive return strong constraints on any possible deviations from \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM+GR in the context of Horndeski gravity. We illustrate how our results can be applied to a more general frameworks of modified gravity models.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a turnkey solution, ready for implementation in numerical codes, for the study of linear structure formation in general scalar-tensor models involving a single universally coupled scalar field. We show that the totality of cosmological information on the gravitational sector can be compressed - without any redundancy - into five independent and arbitrary functions of time only and one constant. These describe physical properties of the universe: the observable background expansion history, fractional matter density today, and four functions of time describing the properties of the dark energy. We show that two of those dark-energy property functions control the existence of anisotropic stress, the other two - dark-energy clustering, both of which are can be scale-dependent. All these properties can in principle be measured, but no information on the underlying theory of acceleration beyond this can be obtained. We present a translation between popular models of late-time acceleration (e.g. perfect fluids, f (R), kinetic gravity braiding, galileons), as well as the effective field theory framework, and our formulation. In this way, implementing this formulation numerically would give a single tool which could consistently test the majority of models of late-time acceleration heretofore proposed.},

  Abstract                 = {These lecture notes introduce analytical tools, methods and results describing the growth of cosmological structure beyond the linear regime. The presentation is focused on the single flow regime of the Vlasov-Poisson equation describing the development of gravitational instabilities in a pressureless fluid. These notes include the introduction of diagrammatic representations of the standard perturbation theory with applications to the calculation of the so-called loop contributions to the power spectra. A large part of these notes is devoted to the exploration of the convergence properties of these terms from the contribution of both the long-wave modes and the short-wave modes. The resulting performances of the two-loop corrections of the power spectra are then presented. Finally other avenues that use different methods are explored. In particular it is shown how joint density and profile probability distribution functions can be constructed out of the multiple-variable cumulant generating functions computed at tree order.},

  Abstract                 = {We review the formalism and applications of non-linear perturbation theory (PT) to understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe. We first discuss the dynamics of gravitational instability, from the linear to the non-linear regime. This includes Eulerian and Lagrangian PT, non-linear approximations, and a brief description of numerical simulation techniques. We then cover the basic statistical tools used in cosmology to describe cosmic fields, such as correlations functions in real and Fourier space, probability distribution functions, cumulants and generating functions. In subsequent sections we review the use of PT to make quantitative predictions about these statistics according to initial conditions, including effects of possible non Gaussianity of the primordial fields. Results are illustrated by detailed comparisons of PT predictions with numerical simulations. The last sections deal with applications to observations. First we review in detail practical estimators of statistics in galaxy catalogs and related errors, including traditional approaches and more recent developments. Then, we consider the effects of the bias between the galaxy distribution and the matter distribution, the treatment of redshift distortions in three-dimensional surveys and of projection effects in angular catalogs, and some applications to weak gravitational lensing. We finally review the current observational situation regarding statistics in galaxy catalogs and what the future generation of galaxy surveys promises to deliver.},

We take into account uncertainties from nonlinear density fluctuations, (scale dependent) galaxy bias, and baryonic effects. Allowing for substantially model independent uncertainties through separate fit parameters in each wavenumber bin that also allow for the redshift evolution, we quantify strong gains in dark energy and neutrino mass leverage with increasing maximum wavenumber, despite marginalizing over numerous (up to 125) extra fit parameters. The leverage is due to not only an increased number of modes but, more significantly, breaking of degeneracies beyond the linear regime.},

  Abstract                 = {We perform an extensive suite of N-body simulations of the matter power spectrum, incorporating massive neutrinos in the range M = 0.15-0.6 eV, probing the non-linear regime at scales k {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextless 10 hMpc-1 at z {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextless 3. We extend the widely used HALOFIT approximation to account for the effect of massive neutrinos on the power spectrum. In the strongly non-linear regime HALOFIT systematically over-predicts the suppression due to the free-streaming of the neutrinos. The maximal discrepancy occurs at k {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextasciitilde 1 hMpc-1, and is at the level of 10\% of the total suppression. Most published constraints on neutrino masses based on HALOFIT are not affected, as they rely on data probing the matter power spectrum in the linear or mildly non-linear regime. However, predictions for future galaxy, Lyman-alpha forest and weak lensing surveys extending to more non-linear scales will benefit from the improved approximation to the non-linear matter power spectrum we provide. Our approximation reproduces the induced neutrino suppression over the targeted scales and redshifts significantly better. We test its robustness with regard to changing cosmological parameters and a variety of modelling effects.},

We discuss the power counting rules and derive explicit expressions for the resummed matter power spectrum up to next-to leading order and the bispectrum at the leading order. The two-point correlation function agrees well with N -body data at BAO scales. The systematic approach also allows to reliably assess the shift of the baryon acoustic peak due to non-linear effects.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe and demonstrate the potential of a new and very efficient method for simulating certain classes of modified gravity theories, such as the widely studied \$f(R)\$ gravity models. High resolution simulations for such models are currently very slow due to the highly nonlinear partial differential equation that needs to be solved exactly to predict the modified gravitational force. This nonlinearity is partly inherent, but is also exacerbated by the specific numerical algorithm used, which employs a variable redefinition to prevent numerical instabilities. The standard Newton-Gauss-Seidel iterative method used to tackle this problem has a poor convergence rate. Our new method not only avoids this, but also allows the discretised equation to be written in a form that is analytically solvable. We show that this new method greatly improves the performance and efficiency of \$f(R)\$ simulations. For example, a test simulation with \$512ˆ3\$ particles in a box of size \$512 {\textbackslash}textbackslash, {\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{Mpc\}/h\$ is now 5 times faster than before, while a Millennium-resolution simulation for \$f(R)\$ gravity is estimated to be more than 20 times faster than with the old method. Our new implementation will be particularly useful for running very high resolution, large-sized simulations which, to date, are only possible for the standard model, and also makes it feasible to run large numbers of lower resolution simulations for covariance analyses. We hope that the method will bring us to a new era for precision cosmological tests of gravity.},

We find that the properties of objects classified according to their surrounding environment shows a substantial dependence on the underlying cosmology; for example, while \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashrm max\}\$ shows average deviations of \${\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashapprox5\$ per cent across the different models when considering the full halo sample, comparing objects classified according to their environment, the size of the deviation can be as large as \$20\$ per cent. We also find that halo spin parameters are positively correlated to the coupling, whereas halo concentrations show the opposite behaviour. Furthermore, when studying the concentration-mass relation in different environments, we find that in all cosmologies underdense regions have a larger normalization and a shallower slope. While this behaviour is found to characterize all the models, differences in the best-fit relations are enhanced in (coupled) dark energy, thus providing a clearer prediction for this class of models.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider cosmological models in which dark matter feels a fifth force mediated by the dark energy scalar field, also known as coupled dark energy. Our interest resides in estimating forecasts for future surveys like Euclid when we take into account non-linear effects, relying on new fitting functions that reproduce the non-linear matter power spectrum obtained from N-body simulations. We obtain fitting functions for models in which the dark matter-dark energy coupling is constant. Their validity is demonstrated for all available simulations in the redshift range \$z=0-1.6\$ and wave modes below \$k=10 {\textbackslash}textbackslashtext\{h/Mpc\}\$. These fitting formulas can be used to test the predictions of the model in the non-linear regime without the need for additional computing-intensive N-body simulations. We then use these fitting functions to perform forecasts on the constraining power that future galaxy-redshift surveys like Euclid will have on the coupling parameter, using the Fisher matrix method for galaxy clustering (GC) and weak lensing (WL). We find that by using information in the non-linear power spectrum, and combining the GC and WL probes, we can constrain the dark matter-dark energy coupling constant squared, \${\textbackslash}textbackslashbetaˆ\{2\}\$, with precision smaller than 4{\textbackslash}textbackslash\% and all other cosmological parameters better than 1{\textbackslash}textbackslash\%, which is a considerable improvement of more than an order of magnitude compared to corresponding linear power spectrum forecasts with the same survey specifications.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the formation and dissipation of large scale neutrino structures in cosmologies where the time evolution of dynamical dark energy is stopped by a growing neutrino mass. In models where the coupling between neutrinos and dark energy grows with the value of the scalar cosmon field, the evolution of neutrino lumps depends on the neutrino mass. For small masses the lumps form and dissolve periodically, leaving only a small backreaction of the neutrino structures on the cosmic evolution. This process heats the neutrinos to temperatures much above the photon temperature such that neutrinos acquire again an almost relativistic equation of state. The present equation of state of the combined cosmon-neutrino fluid is very close to -1. In contrast, for larger neutrino masses the lumps become stable. The highly concentrated neutrino structures entail a large backreaction similar to the case of a constant neutrino-cosmon coupling. A present average neutrino mass of around 0.5 eV seems so far compatible with observation. For masses lower than this value, neutrino induced gravitational potentials remain small, making the lumps difficult to detect.},

We find that one can explore EP violations of order 10ˆ\{-3\} - 10ˆ\{-4\} on cosmological scales. Chameleon models are already very constrained by the requirement of screening within the Solar System and only a very tiny region of the parameter space can be explored with this method.

  Abstract                 = {We develop a new formalism to study nonlinear evolution in the growth of large-scale structure, by following the dynamics of gravitational clustering as it builds up in time. This approach is conveniently represented by Feynman diagrams constructed in terms of three objects: the initial conditions (e.g. perturbation spectrum), the vertex (describing nonlinearities) and the propagator (describing linear evolution). We show that loop corrections to the linear power spectrum organize themselves into two classes of diagrams: one corresponding to mode-coupling effects, the other to a renormalization of the propagator. Resummation of the latter gives rise to a quantity that measures the memory of perturbations to initial conditions as a function of scale. As a result of this, we show that a well-defined (renormalized) perturbation theory follows, in the sense that each term in the remaining mode-coupling series dominates at some characteristic scale and is subdominant otherwise. This is unlike standard perturbation theory, where different loop corrections can become of the same magnitude in the nonlinear regime. In companion papers we compare the resummation of the propagator with numerical simulations, and apply these results to the calculation of the nonlinear power spectrum. Remarkably, the expressions in renormalized perturbation theory can be written in a way that closely resembles the halo model.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a detailed investigation of the effects that a direct interaction between Dark Energy (DE) and Cold Dark Matter (CDM) particles imprints on the Halo Mass Function (HMF) of groups and clusters of galaxies. Making use of the public halo catalogs of the \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashsmall CoDECS\} simulations, we derive the HMF for several different types of coupled DE scenarios both based on the FoF algorithm and on the SO halo identification for different values of the overdensity threshold \${\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashDelta\_\{c\}\$. We compare the computed HMFs for coupled DE cosmologies with \${\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashLambda \$CDM as well as with the predictions of the standard analytic fitting functions. Our results show that the standard fitting functions still reproduce reasonably well both the FoF and the SO HMFs of interacting DE cosmologies at intermediate masses and at low redshifts, once rescaled to the characteristic amplitude of linear density perturbations of each specific model as given by \${\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashsigma\_\{8\}\$. However, we also find that such apparent degeneracy with \${\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashsigma\_\{8\}\$ is broken both by the high-mass tail and by the redshift evolution of our HMFs, with deviations beyond \${\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashsim 10\%\$ for most of the models under investigation. Furthermore, the discrepancy with respect to the predictions of standard fitting functions rescaled with the characteristic value of \${\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashsigma\_\{8\}\$ shows – for some models – a strong dependence on the spherical overdensity threshold \${\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashDelta\_\{c\}\$ used for the halo identification. We find that such effect is due to a significant increase of halo concentration at low redshifts in these models, that is however absent in the majority of the cosmological scenarios considered in this work. We can therefore conclude that the universality of the HMF is violated by cosmological models that feature a direct interaction between DE and CDM.},

  Abstract                 = {This overview article describes the legacy prospect and discovery potential of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) beyond cosmological studies, illustrating it with examples from the DES early data. DES is using a wide-field camera (DECam) on the 4m Blanco Telescope in Chile to image 5000 sq deg of the sky in five filters (grizY). By its completion the survey is expected to have generated a catalogue of 300 million galaxies with photometric redshifts and 100 million stars. In addition, a time-domain survey search over 27 sq deg is expected to yield a sample of thousands of Type Ia supernovae and other transients. The main goals of DES are to characterise dark energy and dark matter, and to test alternative models of gravity; these goals will be pursued by studying large scale structure, cluster counts, weak gravitational lensing and Type Ia supernovae. However, DES also provides a rich data set which allows us to study many other aspects of astrophysics. In this paper we focus on additional science with DES, emphasizing areas where the survey makes a difference with respect to other current surveys. The paper illustrates, using early data (from `Science Verification', and from the first, second and third seasons of observations), what DES can tell us about the solar system, the Milky Way, galaxy evolution, quasars, and other topics. In addition, we show that if the cosmological model is assumed to be Lambda+ Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) then important astrophysics can be deduced from the primary DES probes. Highlights from DES early data include the discovery of 34 Trans Neptunian Objects, 17 dwarf satellites of the Milky Way, one published z {\textbackslash}textgreater 6 quasar (and more confirmed) and two published superluminous supernovae (and more confirmed).},

  Abstract                 = {DESI (Dark Energy Spectropic Instrument) is a Stage IV ground-based dark energy experiment that will study baryon acoustic oscillations and the growth of structure through redshift-space distortions with a wide-area galaxy and quasar redshift survey. The DESI instrument is a robotically-actuated, fiber-fed spectrograph capable of taking up to 5,000 simultaneous spectra over a wavelength range from 360 nm to 980 nm. The fibers feed ten three-arm spectrographs with resolution \$R= {\textbackslash}textbackslashlambda/{\textbackslash}textbackslashDelta{\textbackslash}textbackslashlambda\$ between 2000 and 5500, depending on wavelength. The DESI instrument will be used to conduct a five-year survey designed to cover 14,000 deg\$ˆ2\$. This powerful instrument will be installed at prime focus on the 4-m Mayall telescope in Kitt Peak, Arizona, along with a new optical corrector, which will provide a three-degree diameter field of view. The DESI collaboration will also deliver a spectroscopic pipeline and data management system to reduce and archive all data for eventual public use.},

To probe the Universe out to even higher redshift, DESI will target bright [O II] emission line galaxies up to \$z=1.7\$. Quasars will be targeted both as direct tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution and, at higher redshifts (\$ 2.1 {\textbackslash}textless z {\textbackslash}textless 3.5\$), for the Ly-\${\textbackslash}textbackslashalpha\$ forest absorption features in their spectra, which will be used to trace the distribution of neutral hydrogen. When moonlight prevents efficient observations of the faint targets of the baseline survey, DESI will conduct a magnitude-limited Bright Galaxy Survey comprising approximately 10 million galaxies with a median \$z{\textbackslash}textbackslashapprox 0.2\$. In total, more than 30 million galaxy and quasar redshifts will be obtained to measure the BAO feature and determine the matter power spectrum, including redshift space distortions.},

  Abstract                 = {This review presents a comprehensive overview of galaxy bias, that is, the statistical relation between the distribution of galaxies and matter. We focus on large scales where cosmic density fields are quasi-linear. On these scales, the clustering of galaxies can be described by a perturbative bias expansion, and the complicated physics of galaxy formation is absorbed by a finite set of coefficients of the expansion, called bias parameters. The review begins with a pedagogical proof of this very important result, which forms the basis of the rigorous perturbative description of galaxy clustering, under the assumptions of General Relativity and Gaussian, adiabatic initial conditions. Key components of the bias expansion are all leading local gravitational observables, which includes the matter density but also tidal fields and their time derivatives. We hence expand the definition of local bias to encompass all these contributions. This derivation is followed by a presentation of the peak-background split in its general form, which elucidates the physical meaning of the bias parameters, and a detailed description of the connection between bias parameters and galaxy (or halo) statistics. We then review the excursion set formalism and peak theory which provide predictions for the values of the bias parameters. In the remainder of the review, we consider the generalizations of galaxy bias required in the presence of various types of cosmological physics that go beyond pressureless matter with adiabatic, Gaussian initial conditions: primordial non-Gaussianity, massive neutrinos, baryon-CDM isocurvature perturbations, dark energy, and modified gravity. Finally, we discuss how the description of galaxy bias in the galaxies' rest frame is related to observed clustering statistics measured from the observed angular positions and redshifts in actual galaxy catalogs.},

Each alone is unable to determine all parameters to high accuracy. However, considered together, one data set resolves the difficulties of the other, allowing certain degenerate parameters to be determined with far greater precision. We treat in detail the degeneracies involving the classical cosmological parameters, massive neutrinos, tensor-scalar ratio, bias, and reionization optical depth as well as how redshift surveys can resolve them. We discuss the opportunities for internal and external consistency checks on these measurements. Previous papers on parameter estimation have generally treated smaller parameter spaces; in direct comparisons to these works, we tend to find weaker constraints and suggest numerical explanations for the discrepancies.},

  Abstract                 = {We develop a general method for power spectrum analysis of three dimensional redshift surveys. We present rigorous analytical estimates for the statistical uncertainty in the power and we are able to derive a rigorous optimal weighting scheme under the reasonable (and largely empirically verified) assumption that the long wavelength Fourier components are Gaussian distributed. We apply the formalism to the updated 1-in-6 QDOT IRAS redshift survey, and compare our results to data from other probes: APM angular correlations; the CfA and the Berkeley 1.2Jy IRAS redshift surveys. Our results bear out and further quantify the impression from e.g.{\textbackslash}textbackslash counts-in-cells analysis that there is extra power on large scales as compared to the standard CDM model with \${\textbackslash}textbackslashOmega h{\textbackslash}textbackslashsimeq 0.5\$. We apply likelihood analysis using the CDM spectrum with \${\textbackslash}textbackslashOmega h\$ as a free parameter as a phenomenological family of models; we find the best fitting parameters in redshift space and transform the results to real space. Finally, we calculate the distribution of the estimated long wavelength power. This agrees remarkably well with the exponential distribution expected for Gaussian fluctuations, even out to powers of ten times the mean. Our results thus reveal no trace of periodicity or other non-Gaussian behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {We explore the phenomenological consequences of general late-time modifications of gravity in the quasi-static approximation, in the case where cold dark matter is non-minimally coupled to the gravitational sector. Assuming spectroscopic and photometric surveys with configuration parameters similar to those of the Euclid mission, we derive constraints on our effective description from three observables: the galaxy power spectrum in redshift space, tomographic weak-lensing shear power spectrum and the correlation spectrum between the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and the galaxy distribution. In particular, with \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM as fiducial model and a specific choice for the time dependence of our effective functions, we perform a Fisher matrix analysis and find that the unmarginalized \$68{\textbackslash}\%\$ CL errors on the parameters describing the modifications of gravity are of order \${\textbackslash}sigma{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$--\$10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$. We also consider two other fiducial models. A nonminimal coupling of CDM enhances the effects of modified gravity and reduces the above statistical errors accordingly. In all cases, we find that the parameters are highly degenerate, which prevents the inversion of the Fisher matrices. Some of these degeneracies can be broken by combining all three observational probes.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a universal description of dark energy and modified gravity that includes all single-field models. By extending a formalism previously applied to inflation, we consider the metric universally coupled to matter fields and we write in terms of it the most general unitary gauge action consistent with the residual unbroken symmetries of spatial diffeomorphisms. Our action is particularly suited for cosmological perturbation theory: the background evolution depends on only three operators. All other operators start at least at quadratic order in the perturbations and their effects can be studied independently and systematically. In particular, we focus on the properties of a few operators which appear in non-minimally coupled scalar-tensor gravity and galileon theories. In this context, we study the mixing between gravity and the scalar degree of freedom. We assess the quantum and classical stability, derive the speed of sound of fluctuations and the renormalization of the Newton constant. The scalar can always be de-mixed from gravity at quadratic order in the perturbations, but not necessarily through a conformal rescaling of the metric. We show how to express covariant field-operators in our formalism and give several explicit examples of dark energy and modified gravity models in our language. Finally, we discuss the relation with the covariant EFT methods recently appeared in the literature.},

  Abstract                 = {If dark energy—which drives the accelerated expansion of the universe—consists of a new light scalar field, it might be detectable as a "fifth force" between normal-matter objects, in potential conflict with precision tests of gravity. There has, however, been much theoretical progress in developing theories with screening mechanisms, which can evade detection by suppressing forces in regions of high density, such as the laboratory. One prominent example is the chameleon field. We reduce the effect of this screening mechanism by probing the chameleon with individual atoms rather than bulk matter. Using a cesium matter-wave interferometer near a spherical mass in an ultra-high vacuum chamber, we constrain a wide class of dynamical dark energy theories. Our experiment excludes a range of chameleon theories that reproduce the observed cosmic acceleration.}

Using weak lensing alone, going from SKA1 to SKA2 represents improvements by factors of \${\textbackslash}textbackslashsim10\$ in matter, \${\textbackslash}textbackslashsim8\$ in dark energy and \${\textbackslash}textbackslashsim5\$ in modified gravity parameters. We also show, for the first time, the powerful result that comparably tight constraints (within \${\textbackslash}textbackslashsim5{\textbackslash}textbackslash\%\$) for both Stage III and Stage IV experiments, can be gained from cross-correlating shear maps between the optical and radio wavebands, a process which will also eliminate a number of potential sources of systematic errors which can otherwise greatly limit the utility of weak lensing cosmology.},

  Abstract                 = {We develop a parameterized post-Friedmann (PPF) framework which describes three regimes of modified gravity models that accelerate the expansion without dark energy. On large scales, the evolution of scalar metric and density perturbations must be compatible with the expansion history defined by distance measures. On intermediate scales in the linear regime, they form a scalar-tensor theory with a modified Poisson equation. On small scales in dark matter halos such as our own galaxy, modifications must be suppressed in order to satisfy stringent local tests of general relativity. We describe these regimes with three free functions and two parameters: the relationship between the two metric fluctuations, the large and intermediate scale relationships to density fluctuations and the two scales of the transitions between the regimes. We also clarify the formal equivalence of modified gravity and generalized dark energy. The PPF description of linear fluctuation in f(R) modified action and the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati braneworld models show excellent agreement with explicit calculations. Lacking cosmological simulations of these models, our non-linear halo-model description remains an ansatz but one that enables well-motivated consistency tests of general relativity. The required suppression of modifications within dark matter halos suggests that the linear and weakly non-linear regimes are better suited for making complementary test of general relativity than the deeply non-linear regime.},

Fluctuations in the CMB, baryons, cold dark matter (CDM), and neutrinos receive a boost at horizon crossing. Baryon drag on the photons causes alternating acoustic peak heights in the CMB and is uncovered in its bare form under the photon diffusion scale. Decoupling of the photons at last scattering and of the baryons at the end of the Compton drag epoch, freezes the diffusion-damped acoustic oscillations into the CMB and matter power spectra at different scales. We determine the dependence of the respective acoustic amplitudes and damping lengths on fundamental cosmological parameters. The baryonic oscillations, enhanced by the velocity overshoot effect, compete with CDM fluctuations in the present matter power spectrum. We present new exact analytic solutions for the cold dark matter fluctuations in the presence of a growth- inhibiting radiation \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashit and\} baryon background. Combined with the acoustic contributions and baryonic infall into CDM potential wells, this provides a highly accurate analytic form of the small-scale transfer function in the general case.},

However, the relation between observables and fundamental parameters is more complex and degenerate, especially in the full space of adiabatic cold dark matter models considered here. We introduce a Fisher matrix analysis of the information contained in weak lensing surveys to address these issues and provide a simple means of estimating how survey properties and source redshift uncertainties affect parameter measurement. We find that surveys on degree scales and above can improve the accuracy on parameters that affect the growth rate of structure by up to an order of magnitude compared to using the CMB alone even if the characteristic redshift of the sources must be determined from the data itself. Surprisingly, both sparse sampling and increasing the source redshift can weaken the cosmological constraints.},

  Abstract                 = {Whitening, or sphering, is a common preprocessing step in statistical analysis to transform random variables to orthogonality. However, due to rotational freedom there are infinitely many possible whitening procedures. Consequently, there is a diverse range of sphering methods in use, for example based on principal component analysis (PCA), Cholesky matrix decomposition and zero-phase component analysis (ZCA), among others. Here we provide an overview of the underlying theory and discuss five natural whitening procedures. Subsequently, we demonstrate that investigating the cross-covariance and the cross-correlation matrix between sphered and original variables allows to break the rotational invariance and to identify optimal whitening transformations. As a result we recommend two particular approaches: ZCA-cor whitening to produce sphered variables that are maximally similar to the original variables, and PCA-cor whitening to obtain sphered variables that maximally compress the original variables.},

The power-law index of the primordial power spectrum is n\_s=0.968+-0.012, a measurement that excludes the scale-invariant spectrum by 99.5\%CL. The other parameters are also improved from the 5-year results. Notable examples of improved parameters are the total mass of neutrinos, sum(m\_nu){\textbackslash}textbackslashtextless0.58eV, and the effective number of neutrino species, N\_eff=4.34+0.86-0.88. We detect the effect of primordial helium on the temperature power spectrum and provide a new test of big bang nucleosynthesis. We detect, and show on the map for the first time, the tangential and radial polarization patterns around hot and cold spots of temperature fluctuations, an important test of physical processes at z=1090 and the dominance of adiabatic scalar fluctuations. With the 7-year TB power spectrum, the limit on a rotation of the polarization plane due to potential parity-violating effects has improved to Delta(alpha)=-1.1+-1.4(stat)+-1.5(syst) degrees. We report significant detections of the SZ effect at the locations of known clusters of galaxies. The measured SZ signal agrees well with the expected signal from the X-ray data. However, it is a factor of 0.5 to 0.7 times the predictions from "universal profile" of Arnaud et al., analytical models, and hydrodynamical simulations. We find, for the first time in the SZ effect, a significant difference between the cooling-flow and non-cooling-flow clusters (or relaxed and non-relaxed clusters), which can explain some of the discrepancy. This lower amplitude is consistent with the lower-than-theoretically-expected SZ power spectrum recently measured by the South Pole Telescope collaboration.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a formalism to calculate the non-linear matter power spectrum in modified gravity models that explain the late-time acceleration of the Universe without dark energy. Any successful modified gravity models should contain a mechanism to recover General Relativity (GR) on small scales in order to avoid the stringent constrains on deviations from GR at solar system scales. Based on our formalism, the quasi non-linear power spectrum in the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porratti (DGP) braneworld models and \$f(R)\$ gravity models are derived by taking into account the mechanism to recover GR properly. We also extrapolate our predictions to fully non-linear scales using the Parametrized Post Friedmann (PPF) framework. In \$f(R)\$ gravity models, the predicted non-linear power spectrum is shown to reproduce N-body results. We find that the mechanism to recover GR suppresses the difference between the modified gravity models and dark energy models with the same expansion history, but the difference remains large at weakly non-linear regime in these models. Our formalism is applicable to a wide variety of modified gravity models and it is ready to use once consistent models for modified gravity are developed.},

Using the joint covariance matrix and a Fisher matrix methodology, we examine the prospects of combining these two probes to constrain cosmological and HOD parameters. We find that the combination indeed results in noticeably better constraints, with improvements of order 20\% on cosmological parameters compared to the best single probe, and even greater improvement on HOD parameters, with reduction of error bars by a factor 1.4-4.8.

  Abstract                 = {Euclid is a space-based survey mission from the European Space Agency designed to understand the origin of the Universe's accelerating expansion. It will use cosmological probes to investigate the nature of dark energy, dark matter and gravity by tracking their observational signatures on the geometry of the universe and on the cosmic history of structure formation. The mission is optimised for two independent primary cosmological probes: Weak gravitational Lensing (WL) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). The Euclid payload consists of a 1.2 m Korsch telescope designed to provide a large field of view. It carries two instruments with a common field-of-view of {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde0.54 deg2: the visual imager (VIS) and the near infrared instrument (NISP) which contains a slitless spectrometer and a three bands photometer. The Euclid wide survey will cover 15,000 deg2 of the extragalactic sky and is complemented by two 20 deg2 deep fields. For WL, Euclid measures the shapes of 30-40 resolved galaxies per arcmin2 in one broad visible R+I+Z band (550-920 nm). The photometric redshifts for these galaxies reach a precision of dz/(1+z) {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextless 0.05. They are derived from three additional Euclid NIR bands (Y, J, H in the range 0.92-2.0 micron), complemented by ground based photometry in visible bands derived from public data or through engaged collaborations. The BAO are determined from a spectroscopic survey with a redshift accuracy dz/(1+z) =0.001. The slitless spectrometer, with spectral resolution {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde250, predominantly detects Ha emission line galaxies. Euclid is a Medium Class mission of the ESA Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 programme, with a foreseen launch date in 2019. This report (also known as the Euclid Red Book) describes the outcome of the Phase A study.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the Alcock Paczyński (AP) test applied to the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) feature in the galaxy correlation function. By using a general formalism that includes relativistic effects, we quantify the importance of the linear redshift space distortions and gravitational lensing corrections to the galaxy number density fluctuation. We show that redshift space distortions significantly affect the shape of the correlation function, both in radial and transverse directions, causing different values of galaxy bias to induce offsets up to 1\% in the AP test. On the other hand, we find that the lensing correction around the BAO scale modifies the amplitude but not the shape of the correlation function and therefore does not introduce any systematic effect. Furthermore, we investigate in details how the AP test is sensitive to redshift binning: a window function in transverse direction suppresses correlations and shifts the peak position toward smaller angular scales. We determine the correction that should be applied in order to account for this effect, when performing the test with data from three future planned galaxy redshift surveys: Euclid, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Square Kilometer Array (SKA).},

On the Mayall telescope, DESI will obtain spectra and redshifts for at least 18 million emission-line galaxies, 4 million luminous red galaxies and 3 million quasi-stellar objects, in order to: probe the effects of dark energy on the expansion history using baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), measure the gravitational growth history through redshift-space distortions, measure the sum of neutrino masses, and investigate the signatures of primordial inflation. The resulting 3-D galaxy maps at z{\textbackslash}textless2 and Lyman-alpha forest at z{\textbackslash}textgreater2 will make 1\%-level measurements of the distance scale in 35 redshift bins, thus providing unprecedented constraints on cosmological models.},

  Abstract                 = {In the next few years, we are going to probe the low-redshift universe with unprecedented accuracy. Among the various fruits that this will bear, it will greatly improve our knowledge of the dynamics of dark energy, though for this there is a strong theoretical preference for a cosmological constant. We assume that dark energy is described by the so-called Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy, which assumes that dark energy is the Goldstone boson of time translations. Such a formalism makes it easy to ensure that our signatures are consistent with well-established principles of physics. Since most of the information resides at high wavenumbers, it is important to be able to make predictions at the highest wavenumber that is possible. The Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) is a theoretical framework that has allowed us to make accurate predictions in the mildly non-linear regime. In this paper, we derive the non-linear equations that extend the EFTofLSS to include the effect of dark energy both on the matter fields and on the biased tracers. For the specific case of clustering quintessence, we then perturbatively solve to cubic order the resulting non-linear equations and construct the one-loop power spectrum of the total density contrast.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate cosmologies where dark matter (DM) is coupled to dark energy (DE), through N-body simulations. The dark-dark coupling introduces two novel effects in particle dynamics: (i) DM particle masses vary with time; (ii) gravity between DM particles is ruled by a constant G*, greater than Newton’s constant G, holding in other two-body interactions. Hence, DM particle dynamics violates the equivalence principle and, as a consequence, baryons and DM particle distributions develop a large scale bias. Here we focus on DE models with Ratra-Peebles (RP) potentials. The dark-dark coupling is set in a parametric range compatible with background and linear dynamics. We find that nonlinear dynamics puts additional constraints on the coupling parameter. They mostly arise from cluster density profiles that we find to yield higher concentrations in coupled RP models, with respect to (uncoupled) dynamical DE cosmologies. Such an enhancement, although being a strong effect in some coupling parameter range, leads to acceptable observables for a significant range of values of the coupling parameter. We also analyze the expected cluster mass function and the DM-baryon bias in nonlinear conditions, finding them compatible with data. With the above restrictions, coupled DE models with a RP potential are therefore consistent with cosmological nonlinear observables. As a general conclusion, we confirm that cosmologies with a suitable dark-dark coupling are viable theories.},

  Abstract                 = {We evaluate the mass function of virialized halos, by using Press \& Schechter (PS) and/or Steth \& Tormen (ST) expressions, for cosmologies where Dark Energy (DE) is due to a scalar self-interacting field, coupled with Dark Matter (DM). We keep to coupled DE (cDE) models known to fit linear observables. To implement the PS-ST approach, we start from reviewing and extending the results of a previous work on the growth of a spherical top-hat fluctuation in cDE models, confirming their most intriguing astrophysical feature, i.e. a significant baryon-DM segregation, occurring well before the onset of any hydrodynamical effect. Accordingly, the predicted mass function depends on how halo masses are measured. For any option, however, the coupling causes a distortion of the mass function, still at z=0. Furthermore, the z-dependence of cDE mass functions is mostly displaced, in respect to LambdaCDM, in the opposite way of uncoupled dynamical DE. This is an aspect of the basic underlying result, that even a little DM-DE coupling induces relevant modifications in the non-linear evolution. Therefore, without causing great shifts in linear astrophysical observables, the DM-baryon segregation induced by the coupling can have an impact on a number of cosmological problems, it e.g., galaxy satellite abundance, spiral disk formation, apparent baryon shortage, entropy input in clusters, etc..},

  Abstract                 = {Standard cosmological perturbation theory (SPT) for the Large Scale Structure (LSS) of the Universe fails at small scales (UV) due to strong nonlinearities and to multistreaming effects. In Pietroni et al. 2011 a new framework was proposed in which the large scales (IR) are treated perturbatively while the information on the UV, mainly small scale velocity dispersion, is obtained by nonlinear methods like N-body simulations. Here we develop this approach, showing that it is possible to reproduce the fully nonlinear power spectrum (PS) by combining a simple (and fast) 1-loop computation for the IR scales and the measurement of a single, dominant, correlator from N-body simulations for the UV ones. We measure this correlator for a suite of seven different cosmologies, and we show that its inclusion in our perturbation scheme reproduces the fully non-linear PS with percent level accuracy, for wave numbers up to \$k{\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashsim 0.4{\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslash, h{\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashrm Mpcˆ\{-1\}\}\$ down to \$z=0\$. We then show that, once this correlator has been measured in a given cosmology, there is no need to run a new simulation for a different cosmology in the suite. Indeed, by rescaling this correlator by a proper function computable in SPT, the reconstruction procedure works also for the other cosmologies and for all redshifts, with comparable accuracy. Finally, we clarify the relation of this approach to the Effective Field Theory methods recently proposed in the LSS context.},

With terms up to kˆ4, the model can predict the true power spectrum to a few per cent accuracy up to k ∼ 0.7 h Mpcˆ−1, over a wide range of redshifts and models. The A\_n coefficients contain information about cosmology, in particular amplitude of fluctuations. We write a simple form of the covariance matrix as a sum of Gaussian part and A\_0 variance, which reproduces the simulations remarkably well. In contrast, we show that one needs an N-body simulation volume of more than 1000 (Gpc hˆ−1)ˆ3 to converge to 1 per cent accuracy on covariance matrix. We investigate the supersample variance effect and show it can be modelled as an additional parameter that can be determined from the data. This allows a determination of σ\_8 amplitude to about 0.2 per cent for a survey volume of 1(Gpc hˆ−1)ˆ3, compared to 0.4 per cent otherwise. We explore the sensitivity of these coefficients to baryonic effects using hydrodynamic simulations of van Daalen et al. We find that because of baryons redistributing matter inside haloes all the coefficients A2n for n {\textbackslash}textgreater 0 are strongly affected by baryonic effects, while A0 remains almost unchanged, a consequence of halo mass conservation. Our results suggest that observations such as weak lensing power spectrum can be effectively marginalized over the baryonic effects, while still preserving the bulk of the cosmological information contained in A0 and Zeldovich terms.},

  Abstract                 = {Although cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data alone cannot constrain simultaneously the spatial curvature and the equation of state of dark energy, CMB data provide a valuable addition to other experimental results. However computing a full CMB power spectrum with a Boltzmann code is quite slow; for instance if we want to work with many dark energy and/or modified gravity models, or would like to optimize experiments where many different configurations need to be tested, it is possible to adopt a quicker and more efficient approach. In this paper we consider the compression of the projected Planck CMB data into four parameters, R (scaled distance to last scattering surface), l\_a (angular scale of sound horizon at last scattering), Omega\_b hˆ2 (baryon density fraction) and n\_s (powerlaw index of primordial matter power spectrum), all of which can be computed quickly. We show that, although this compression loses information compared to the full likelihood, such information loss becomes negligible when more data is added. We also demonstrate that the method can be used for scalar field dark energy independently of the parametrisation of the equation of state, and discuss how this method should be used for other kinds of dark energy models.},

  Abstract                 = {Future galaxy surveys will map the galaxy distribution in the redshift interval \$0.5{\textbackslash}textbackslashtextlessz{\textbackslash}textbackslashtextless2\$ using near-infrared cameras and spectrographs. The primary science goal of such surveys is to constrain the nature of the dark energy by measuring the large-scale structure of the Universe. This requires a tracer of the underlying dark matter which maximizes the useful volume of the survey. We investigate two potential survey selection methods: an emission line sample based on the {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashha line and a sample selected in the H-band. We present predictions for the abundance and clustering of such galaxies, using two published versions of the {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashgalform galaxy formation model. Our models predict that {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashha selected galaxies tend to avoid massive dark matter haloes and instead trace the surrounding filamentary structure; H-band selected galaxies, on the other hand, are found in the highest mass haloes. This has implications for the measurement of the rate at which fluctuations grow due to gravitational instability. We use mock catalogues to compare the effective volumes sampled by a range of survey configurations. To give just two examples: a redshift survey down to \$H\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashrm AB\}=22\$ samples an effective volume that is \${\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashsim 5-10\$ times larger than that probed by an {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashha survey with \${\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashlogfha {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextgreater -15.4\$; a flux limit of at least \${\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashlogfha = -16\$ is required for an {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashha sample to become competitive in effective volume.},

  Abstract                 = {Modified gravity theories predict in general a non standard equation for the propagation of gravitational waves. Here we discuss the impact of modified friction and speed of tensor modes on cosmic microwave polarization B modes. We show that the non standard friction term, parametrized by \${\textbackslash}textbackslashalpha\_\{M\}\$, is degenerate with the tensor-to-scalar ratio \$r\$, so that small values of \$r\$ can be compensated by negative constant values of \${\textbackslash}textbackslashalpha\_M\$. We quantify this degeneracy and its dependence on the epoch at which \${\textbackslash}textbackslashalpha\_\{M\}\$ is different from the standard, zero, value and on the speed of gravitational waves \$c\_\{T\}\$. In the particular case of scalar-tensor theories, \${\textbackslash}textbackslashalpha\_\{M\}\$ is constant and strongly constrained by background and scalar perturbations, \$0{\textbackslash}textbackslashle {\textbackslash}textbackslashalpha\_\{M\}{\textbackslash}textless 0.01\$ and the degeneracy with \$r\$ is removed. In more general cases however such tight bounds are weakened and the B modes can provide useful constraints on early-time modified gravity.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate constraints on early dark energy (EDE) from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy, taking into account data from WMAP9 combined with latest small scale measurements from the South Pole Telescope (SPT). For a constant EDE fraction we propose a new parametrization with one less parameter but still enough to provide similar results to the ones previously studied in literature. The main emphasis of our analysis, however, compares a new set of different EDE parametrizations that reveal how CMB constraints depend on the redshift epoch at which Dark Energy was non negligible. We find that bounds on EDE get substantially weaker if dark energy starts to be non-negligible later, with early dark energy fraction Omega\_e free to go up to about 5\% at 2 sigma if the onset of EDE happens at z {\textbackslash}textless 100. Tight bounds around 1-2\% are obtained whenever dark energy is present at last scattering, even if its effects switch off afterwards. We show that the CMB mainly constrains the presence of Dark Energy at the time of its emission, while EDE-modifications of the subsequent growth of structure are less important.},

  Abstract                 = {Semi-analytical methods, based on Eulerian perturbation theory, are a promising tool to follow the time evolution of cosmological perturbations at small redshifts and at mildly nonlinear scales. All these schemes are based on two approximations: the existence of a smoothing scale and the single-stream approximation, where velocity dispersion of the dark matter fluid, as well as higher moments of the particle distributions, are neglected. Despite being widely recognized, these two assumptions are, in principle, incompatible, since any finite smoothing scale gives rise to velocity dispersion and higher moments at larger scales. We describe a new approach to perturbation theory, where the Vlasov and fluid equations are derived in presence of a finite coarse-graining scale: this allows a clear separation between long and short distance modes and leads to a hybrid approach where the former are treated perturbatively and the effect of the latter is encoded in external source terms for velocity, velocity dispersion, and all the higher order moments, which can be computed from N-body simulations. We apply the coarse-grained perturbation theory to the computation of the power spectrum and the cross-spectrum between density and velocity dispersion, and compare the results with N-body simulations, finding good agreement.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents cosmological results based on full-mission Planck observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Our results are in very good agreement with the 2013 analysis of the Planck nominal-mission temperature data, but with increased precision. The temperature and polarization power spectra are consistent with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter ΛCDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base ΛCDM" in this paper). From the Planck temperature data combined with Planck lensing, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0 = (67.8 ± 0.9) km s-1Mpc-1, a matter density parameter Ωm = 0.308 ± 0.012, and a tilted scalar spectral index with ns = 0.968 ± 0.006, consistent with the 2013 analysis. Note that in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence limits on measured parameters and 95\% upper limits on other parameters. We present the first results of polarization measurements with the Low Frequency Instrument at large angular scales. Combined with the Planck temperature and lensing data, these measurements give a reionization optical depth of τ = 0.066 ± 0.016, corresponding to a reionization redshift of z\_re=8.8+1.7-1.4. These results are consistent with those from WMAP polarization measurements cleaned for dust emission using 353-GHz polarization maps from the High Frequency Instrument. We find no evidence for any departure from base ΛCDM in the neutrino sector of the theory; for example, combining Planck observations with other astrophysical data we find Neff = 3.15 ± 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, consistent with the value Neff = 3.046 of the Standard Model of particle physics. The sum of neutrino masses is constrained to ∑ mν {\textbackslash}textless 0.23 eV. The spatial curvature of our Universe is found to be very close to zero, with {\textbackslash}textbar ΩK {\textbackslash}textbar {\textbackslash}textless 0.005. Adding a tensor component as a single-parameter extension to base ΛCDM we find an upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r0.002{\textbackslash}textless 0.11, consistent with the Planck 2013 results and consistent with the B-mode polarization constraints from a joint analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP B-mode data to our analysis leads to a tighter constraint of r0.002 {\textbackslash}textless 0.09 and disfavours inflationarymodels with a V(φ) ∝ φ2 potential. The addition of Planck polarization data leads to strong constraints on deviations from a purely adiabatic spectrum of fluctuations. We find no evidence for any contribution from isocurvature perturbations or from cosmic defects. Combining Planck data with other astrophysical data, including Type Ia supernovae, the equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 ± 0.045, consistent with the expected value for a cosmological constant. The standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the best-fit Planck base ΛCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We also constraints on annihilating dark matter and on possible deviations from the standard recombination history. In neither case do we find no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base ΛCDM are in good agreement with baryon acoustic oscillation data and with the JLA sample of Type Ia supernovae. However, as in the 2013 analysis, the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum is found to be higher than inferred from some analyses of rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. We show that these tensions cannot easily be resolved with simple modifications of the base ΛCDM cosmology. Apart from these tensions, the base ΛCDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

  Abstract                 = {Phenomenological functions \${\textbackslash}Sigma\$ and \${\textbackslash}mu\$ (also known as \$G\_\{{\textbackslash}rm light\}/G\$ and \$G\_\{{\textbackslash}rm matter\}/G\$) are commonly used to parametrize possible modifications of the Poisson equation relating the matter density contrast to the lensing and the Newtonian potentials, respectively. They will be well constrained by future surveys of large scale structure. But what would the implications of measuring particular values of these functions be for modified gravity theories? We ask this question in the context of general Horndeski class of single field scalar-tensor theories with second order equations of motion. We find several consistency conditions that make it possible to rule out broad classes of theories based on measurements of \${\textbackslash}Sigma\$ and \${\textbackslash}mu\$ that are independent of their parametric forms. For instance, a measurement of \${\textbackslash}Sigma {\textbackslash}ne 1\$ would rule out all models with a canonical form of kinetic energy, while finding \${\textbackslash}Sigma-1\$ and \${\textbackslash}mu -1\$ to be of opposite sign would rule out the entire class of Horndeski models. We separately examine the large and the small scale limits, the possibility of scale-dependence, and the consistency with bounds on the speed of gravitational waves. We identify sub-classes of Horndeski theories that can be ruled out based on the measured difference between \${\textbackslash}Sigma\$ and \${\textbackslash}mu\$.},

  Abstract                 = {The peculiar motion of galaxies can be a particularly sensitive probe of gravitational collapse. As such, it can be used to measure the dynamics of dark matter and dark energy as well the nature of the gravitational laws at play on cosmological scales. Peculiar motions manifest themselves as an overall anisotropy in the measured clustering signal as a function of the angle to the line-of-sight, known as redshift-space distortion (RSD). Limiting factors in this measurement include our ability to model non-linear galaxy motions on small scales and the complexities of galaxy bias. The anisotropy in the measured clustering pattern in redshift-space is also driven by the unknown distance factors at the redshift in question, the Alcock-Paczynski distortion. This weakens growth rate measurements, but permits an extra geometric probe of the Hubble expansion rate. In this chapter we will briefly describe the scientific background to the RSD technique, and forecast the potential of the SKA phase 1 and the SKA2 to measure the growth rate using both galaxy catalogues and intensity mapping, assessing their competitiveness with current and future optical galaxy surveys.},

  Abstract                 = {HI intensity mapping (IM) is a novel technique capable of mapping the large-scale structure of the Universe in three dimensions and delivering exquisite constraints on cosmology, by using HI as a biased tracer of the dark matter density field. This is achieved by measuring the intensity of the redshifted 21cm line over the sky in a range of redshifts without the requirement to resolve individual galaxies. In this chapter, we investigate the potential of SKA1 to deliver HI intensity maps over a broad range of frequencies and a substantial fraction of the sky. By pinning down the baryon acoustic oscillation and redshift space distortion features in the matter power spectrum -- thus determining the expansion and growth history of the Universe -- these surveys can provide powerful tests of dark energy models and modifications to General Relativity. They can also be used to probe physics on extremely large scales, where precise measurements of spatial curvature and primordial non-Gaussianity can be used to test inflation; on small scales, by measuring the sum of neutrino masses; and at high redshifts where non-standard evolution models can be probed. We discuss the impact of foregrounds as well as various instrumental and survey design parameters on the achievable constraints. In particular we analyse the feasibility of using the SKA1 autocorrelations to probe the large-scale signal.},

The effect is enhanced significantly by the extra coupling and can be at the 2-3 percent level in the range of scales of baryonic acoustic oscillations.

  Abstract                 = {We derive the exact relationship, including all nonlinearities, between real-space and redshift-space two-point statistics through the pairwise velocity distribution function. We show using numerical simulations that the pairwise velocity probability distribution function is strongly non-Gaussian at all scales and explain why this is so. We caution that a commonly used ansatz to model the redshift-space power spectrum gives rise to an unphysical distribution of pairwise velocities, and show that it is in general impossible to derive the distribution from measurements of redshift-space clustering. Methods that claim to do this obtain instead something else, whose properties we derive. We provide a general derivation of the large-scale limit of the redshift-space power spectrum and show that it differs from the Kaiser formula by terms that depend on Gaussian and non-Gaussian contributions to the velocity dispersion of large-scale flows. We also show that the large-scale evolution of velocity fields is not well described by linear theory and discuss how this impacts the redshift-space power spectrum. Finally, we stress that using the monopole of the redshift-space power as an indicator of the real-space power spectrum shape can lead to systematic effects in the determination of cosmological parameters; nevertheless a simple procedure is able to recover the large-scale real-space power spectrum rather well.},

  Abstract                 = {To shed light on the fundamental problems posed by Dark Energy and Dark Matter, a large number of experiments have been performed and combined to constrain cosmological models. We propose a novel way of quantifying the information gained by updates on the parameter constraints from a series of experiments which can either complement earlier measurements or replace them. For this purpose, we use the Kullback-Leibler divergence or relative entropy from information theory to measure differences in the posterior distributions in model parameter space from a pair of experiments. We apply this formalism to a historical series of Cosmic Microwave Background experiments ranging from Boomerang to WMAP, SPT, and Planck. Considering different combinations of these experiments, we thus estimate the information gain in units of bits and distinguish contributions from the reduction of statistical errors and the `surprise' corresponding to a significant shift of the parameters' central values. For this experiment series, we find individual relative entropy gains ranging from about 1 to 30 bits. In some cases, e.g. when comparing WMAP and Planck results, we find that the gains are dominated by the surprise rather than by improvements in statistical precision. We discuss how this technique provides a useful tool for both quantifying the constraining power of data from cosmological probes and detecting the tensions between experiments.},

While the Fisher Matrix formalism is limited to yield ellipsoidal confidence contours, our method can reproduce the often observed flexed, deformed or curved shapes of known posteriors. This gain in shape fidelity is obtained by expanding the posterior to higher order in derivatives with respect to parameters, such that non-Gaussianity in the parameter space is taken into account. The resulting expansion is positive definite and normalizable at every order. Here, we present the new technique, highlight its advantages and limitations, and show a representative application to a posterior of dark energy parameters from supernovae measurements.},

Meanwhile we accommodate the Lagrangian displacement distribution into the Fisher matrix calculation to reflect the gradual loss of information in scale and in time due to nonlinear growth, nonlinear bias, and nonlinear redshift distortions. We then show that we can contract the multi-dimensional Fisher matrix calculations into a 2-dimensional or even 1-dimensional formalism with physically motivated approximations. We present the resulting fitting formula for the cosmological distance errors from galaxy redshift surveys as a function of survey parameters and nonlinearity, which saves us going through the 12-dimensional Fisher matrix calculations. Finally, we show excellent agreement between the distance error estimates from the revised Fisher matrix and the precision on the distance scale recovered from N-body simulations.},

While mildly biased tracers follow the matter power spectrum well, redshift distortions do partially obscure baryonic features in redshift space compared to real space. We calculate the statistical constraints on cosmological distortions from N-body results and compare these to the analytic results from a Fisher matrix formalism.

This, in turn, enables one to probe dark energy. We use a Fisher matrix formalism to study the statistical errors for redshift surveys up to z=3 and report errors on cosmography while marginalizing over a large number of cosmological parameters including a time-dependent equation of state. With redshifts surveys combined with cosmic microwave background satellite data, we achieve errors of 0.037 on Omega\_x, 0.10 on w(z=0.8), and 0.28 on dw(z)/dz for cosmological constant model. Models with less negative w(z) permit tighter constraints. We test and discuss the dependence of performance on redshift, survey conditions, and fiducial model. We find results that are competitive with the performance of future supernovae Ia surveys. We conclude that redshift surveys offer a promising independent route to the measurement of dark energy.},

We perform such an analysis by combining measurements of cosmic shear tomography from the Canada-France Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) with the growth of structure from the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey and the Six-degree-Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGS), producing the strongest existing joint constraints on the metric potentials that describe general theories of gravity. For scale-independent modifications to the metric potentials which evolve linearly with the effective dark energy density, we find present-day cosmological deviations in the Newtonian potential and curvature potential from the prediction of General Relativity to be (Delta Psi)/Psi = 0.05 {\textbackslash}textbackslashpm 0.25 and (Delta Phi)/Phi = -0.05 {\textbackslash}textbackslashpm 0.3 respectively (68 per cent CL).},

However, modified gravity can be degenerate in its effect with the unknown values of cosmological parameters. More seriously, even the `observed' value of the RSD (redshift-space distortions) used to measure the fluctuation growth rate depends on the assumed cosmological parameters (the Alcock-Paczynski effect). We give a full analysis of these issues, showing how to combine RSD with BAO (baryon acoustic oscillations) and CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) data, in order to obtain joint constraints on deviations from general relativity and on the equation of state of dark energy whilst allowing for factors such as non-zero curvature. In particular we note that the evolution of Omega\_m(z), along with the Alcock-Paczynski effect, produces a degeneracy between the equation of state w and the modified growth parameter gamma. Typically, the total marginalized error on either of these parameters will be larger by a factor {\textasciitilde} 2 compared to the conditional error where one or other is held fixed. We argue that future missions should be judged by their Figure of Merit as defined in the w\_p - gamma plane, and note that the inclusion of spatial curvature can degrade this value by an order of magnitude.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the results of a large library of cosmological N-body simulations, using power-law initial spectra. The non-linear evolution of the matter power spectra is compared with the predictions of existing analytic scaling formulae based on the work of Hamilton et al. The scaling approach has assumed that highly non-linear structures obey ‘stable clustering’ and are frozen in proper coordinates. Our results show that, when transformed under the self-similarity scaling, the scale-free spectra define a non-linear locus that is clearly shallower than would be required under stable clustering. Furthermore, the small-scale non-linear power increases as both the power spectrum index n and the density parameter Ω decrease, and this evolution is not well accounted for by the previous scaling formulae. This breakdown of stable clustering can be understood as resulting from the modification of dark matter haloes by continuing mergers. These effects are naturally included in the analytic ‘halo model’ for non-linear structure; we use this approach to fit both our scale-free results and also our previous cold dark matter data. This method is more accurate than the commonly used Peacock–Dodds formula and should be applicable to more general power spectra. Code to evaluate non-linear power spectra using this method is available from http://as1.chem.nottingham.ac.uk/{\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextasciitilderes/software.html.

  Abstract                 = {The apparent anisotropies of the galaxy clustering in observable redshift space provide a unique opportunity to simultaneously probe cosmic expansion and gravity on cosmological scales via the Alcock–Paczynski effect and redshift-space distortions. While the improved theoretical models have been proposed and developed to describe the apparent anisotropic clustering at weakly non-linear scales, the applicability of these models is still limited in the presence of the non–perturbative smearing effect caused by the randomness of the relative velocities. Although the cosmological constraint from the anisotropic clustering will be certainly improved with a more elaborate theoretical model, we here consider an alternative way by using the statistical power of both the power spectrum and bispectrum at large scales. Based on the Fisher matrix analysis, we estimate the benefit of combining the power spectra and bispectra, finding that the constraints on the cosmic expansion and growth of structure will be improved by a factor of two. This compensates for the loss of constraining power using the power spectrum alone due to the randomness of the relative velocities.},

Identifying voids with the VIDE toolkit, we find no statistically significant differences in the ellipticities, but find that coupling produces a population of significantly larger voids, possibly explaining the recent result of Tavasoli et al. (2013). In addition, we use the universal density profile of Hamaus et al. (2014) to quantify the relationship between coupling and density profile shape, finding that the coupling leads to deeper underdensities for medium-scale voids and broader, shallower, undercompensated profiles for large voids. We find that these differences are potentially measurable with existing void catalogs once effects from survey geometries and peculiar velocities are taken into account.},

While the halofit model has been frequently used as a standard cosmological tool to predict the nonlinear matter power spectrum in a universe dominated by cold dark matter, its precision has been limited by the low-resolution of \$N\$-body simulations used to determine the fitting parameters, suggesting the necessity of improved fitting formula at small scales for future cosmological studies. We run high-resolution \$N\$-body simulations for 16 cosmological models around the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) best-fit cosmological parameters (1, 3, 5, and 7 year results), including dark energy models with a constant equation of state. The simulation results are used to re-calibrate the fitting parameters of the halofit model so as to reproduce small-scale power spectra of the \$N\$-body simulations, while keeping the precision at large scales. The revised fitting formula provides an accurate prediction of the nonlinear matter power spectrum in a wide range of wavenumber (\$k {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashleq 30h\${\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslash,Mpc\$ˆ\{-1\}\$) at redshifts \$0 {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashleq z {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashleq 10\$, with 5\% precision for \$k{\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashleq1 h\$ Mpc\$ˆ\{-1\}\$ at \$0 {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashleq z {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashleq 10\$ and 10\% for \$1 {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashleq k{\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashleq 10 h\$ Mpc\$ˆ\{-1\} \$ at \$0 {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashleq z {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashleq 3\$.

We use a total of 5000 cosmological N-body simulations to study in detail the distribution of best-fit cosmological parameters and the baryon acoustic peak positions. The obtained distribution is compared with the results from the Fisher matrix analysis with and without including non-Gaussian errors. For the Fisher matrix analysis, we compute the derivatives of the matter power spectrum with respect to cosmological parameters using directly full nonlinear simulations. We show that the non-Gaussian errors increase the unmarginalized errors by up to a factor 5 for k\_\{max\}=0.4h/Mpc if there is only one free parameter provided other parameters are well determined by external information. On the other hand, for multi-parameter fitting, the impact of the non-Gaussian errors is significantly mitigated due to severe parameter degeneracies in the power spectrum. The distribution of the acoustic peak positions is well described by a Gaussian distribution, with its width being consistent with the statistical interval predicted from the Fisher matrix. We also examine systematic bias in the best-fit parameter due to the non-Gaussian errors. The bias is found to be smaller than the 1 sigma statistical error for both the cosmological parameters and the acoustic scale positions.},

  Abstract                 = {Based on the multi-point propagator expansion, we present resummed perturbative calculations for cosmological power spectra and correlation functions in the context of modified gravity. In a wide class of modified gravity models that have a screening mechanism to recover general relativity (GR) on small scales, we apply the eikonal approximation to derive the governing equation for resummed propagator that partly includes the non-perturbative effect in the high-k limit. The resultant propagator in the high-k limit contains the new corrections arising from the screening mechanism as well as the standard exponential damping. We explicitly derive the expression for new high-k contributions in specific modified gravity models, and find that in the case of f(R) gravity for a currently constrained model parameter, the corrections are basically of the sub-leading order and can be neglected. Thus, in f(R) gravity, similarly to the GR case, we can analytically construct the regularized propagator that reproduces both the resummed high-k behavior and the low-k results computed with standard perturbation theory, consistently taking account of the nonlinear modification of gravity valid at large scales. With the regularized multi-point propagators, we give predictions for power spectrum and correlation function at one-loop order, and compare those with N-body simulations in f(R) gravity model. As an important application, we also discuss the redshift-space distortions and compute the anisotropic power spectra and correlation functions.},

Contrary to the models of redshift distortion phenomenologically introduced but frequently used in the literature, the new model includes the corrections arising from the nonlinear coupling between the density and velocity fields associated with two competitive effects of redshift distortion, i.e., Kaiser and Finger-of-God effects. Based on the improved treatment of perturbation theory for gravitational clustering, we compare our model predictions with the monopole and quadrupole power spectra of N-body simulations, and an excellent agreement is achieved over the scales of BAOs. Potential impacts on constraining dark energy and modified gravity from the redshift-space power spectrum are also investigated based on the Fisher-matrix formalism, particularly focusing on the measurements of the Hubble parameter, angular diameter distance, and growth rate for structure formation. We find that the existing phenomenological models of redshift distortion produce a systematic error on measurements of the angular diameter distance and Hubble parameter by 1\%–2\% , and the growth-rate parameter by ∼5\%, which would become non-negligible for future galaxy surveys. Correctly modeling redshift distortion is thus essential, and the new prescription for the redshift-space power spectrum including the nonlinear corrections can be used as an accurate theoretical template for anisotropic BAOs.},

The full shear-ratio covariance matrix is calculated for lensed sources, including the intervening large-scale structure and photometric redshift errors as additional sources of noise, and a maximum likelihood method for applying the test is presented. Decomposing the lensing matter distribution into dark matter haloes we calculate the parameter covariance matrix for an arbitrary experiment. Combining with the expected results from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) we design an optimal survey for probing dark energy. This shows that a targeted survey imaging 60 of the largest clusters in a hemisphere with five-band optical photometric redshifts to a median galaxy depth of zm= 0.9 could measure w0≡w(z= 0) to a marginal 1σ error of Δw0= 0.5. We marginalize over all other parameters including wa, where the equation of state is parametrized in terms of scalefactor a as w(a) =w0+wa(1 −a). For higher accuracy a large-scale photometric redshift survey is required, where the largest gain in signal arises from the numerous ≈1014 M⊙ haloes corresponding to medium-sized galaxy clusters. Combined with the expected Planck Surveyor results, such a near-future five-band survey covering 10 000 deg2 to zm= 0.7 could measure w0 to Δw0= 0.075 and Δwa= 0.33. A stronger combined constraint is put on w measured at the pivot redshift zp= 0.27 of Δw(zp) = 0.0298. We compare and combine the geometric test with the cosmological and dark energy parameters measured from planned baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and supernova Type Ia experiments, and find that the geometric test results combine with a significant reduction in errors due to different degeneracies. A combination of geometric lensing, CMB and BAO experiments could achieve Δw0= 0.047 and Δwa= 0.111 with a pivot redshift constraint of Δw(zp) = 0.020 at zp= 0.62. Simple relations are presented that show how our lensing results can be scaled to other telescope classes and survey parameters.},

We present a rigorous discussion of different methods of power spectrum estimation, with emphasis on the traditional Fourier method, the linear (Karhunen-Loeve; KL), and quadratic data compression schemes, showing in what approximations they give the same result. To improve speed, we show how many of the advantages of KL data compression and power spectrum estimation may be achieved with a computationally faster quadratic method. To improve accuracy, we derive analytic expressions for handling the integral constraint, since it is crucial that finite volume effects are accurately corrected for on scales comparable to the depth of the survey. We also show that for the KL and quadratic techniques, multiple constraints can be included via simple matrix operations, thereby rendering the results less sensitive to galactic extinction and mis-estimates of the radial selection function. We present a data analysis pipeline that we argue does justice to the increases in both quality and quantity of data that upcoming redshift surveys will provide. It uses three analysis techniques in conjunction: a traditional Fourier approach on small scales, a pixelized quadratic matrix method on large scales and a pixelized KL eigenmode analysis to probe anisotropic effects such as redshift-space distortions.},

We examine the most recent developments in redshift-space distortions modelling, which account for non-linearities on both small and intermediate scales produced respectively by randomised motions in virialised structures and non-linear coupling between the density and velocity fields. We consider the possibility of including the linear component of galaxy bias as a free parameter and directly estimate the growth rate of structure f.

(2010), the most sophisticated one considered in this analysis, provides in general the most unbiased estimates of the growth rate of structure, with systematic errors within 4\% over a wide range of galaxy populations spanning luminosities between L {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextgreater L* and L {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextgreater 3L*. The scale-dependence of galaxy bias plays a role on recovering unbiased estimates of f when fitting quasi non-linear scales. Its effect is particularly severe for most luminous galaxies, for which systematic effects in the modelling might be more difficult to mitigate and have to be further investigated. [...]},

  Abstract                 = {We present a quantitative analysis of the largest contiguous maps of projected mass density obtained from gravitational lensing shear. We use data from the 154 deg2 covered by the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey. Our study is the first attempt to quantitatively characterize the scientific value of lensing maps, which could serve in the future as a complementary approach to the study of the dark universe with gravitational lensing. We show that mass maps contain unique cosmological information beyond that of traditional two-points statistical analysis techniques. Using a series of numerical simulations, we first show how, reproducing the CFHTLenS observing conditions, gravitational lensing inversion provides a reliable estimate of the projected matter distribution of large scale structure. We validate our analysis by quantifying the robustness of the maps with various statistical estimators. We then apply the same process to the CFHTLenS data. We find that the 2-points correlation function of the projected mass is consistent with the cosmological analysis performed on the shear correlation function discussed in the CFHTLenS companion papers. The maps also lead to a significant measurement of the third order moment of the projected mass, which is in agreement with analytic predictions, and to a marginal detection of the fourth order moment. Tests for residual systematics are found to be consistent with zero for the statistical estimators we used. A new approach for the comparison of the reconstructed mass map to that predicted from the galaxy distribution reveals the existence of giant voids in the dark matter maps as large as 3 degrees on the sky. Our analysis shows that lensing mass maps can be used for new techniques such as peak statistics and the morphological analysis of the projected dark matter distribution.},

  Abstract                 = {The emergence of cosmic structure is commonly considered one of the most complex phenomena in Nature. However, this complexity has never been defined nor measured in a quantitative and objective way. In this work we propose a method to measure the information content of cosmic structure and to quantify the complexity that emerges from it, based on Information Theory. The emergence of complex evolutionary patterns is studied with a statistical symbolic analysis of the datastream produced by state-of-the-art cosmological simulations of forming galaxy clusters. This powerful approach allows us to measure how many bits of information are necessary to predict the evolution of energy fields in a statistical way, and it offers a simple way to quantify when, where and how the cosmic gas behaves in complex ways. The most complex behaviors are found in the peripheral regions of galaxy clusters, where supersonic flows drive shocks and large energy fluctuations over a few tens of million years. Describing the evolution of magnetic energy requires at least a twice as large amount of bits than for the other energy fields. When radiative cooling and feedback from galaxy formation are considered, the cosmic gas is overall found to double its degree of complexity. In the future, Cosmic Information Theory can significantly increase our understanding of the emergence of cosmic structure as it represents an innovative framework to design and analyze complex simulations of the Universe in a simple, yet powerful way.},

We propose a way to quantify whether cosmological parameters constraints from two different experiments are in tension or not. Our statistic, T , is an evidence ratio and therefore can be interpreted with the widely used Jeffrey’s scale. We find that in the framework of the ΛCDM model, the Planck inferred two dimensional, joint, posterior distribution for the Hubble constant and age of the Universe is in “strong” tension with the local measurements; the odds being ∼1:50. We explore several possibilities for explaining this tension and examine the consequences both in terms of unknown errors and deviations from the ΛCDM model. In some one-parameter ΛCDM model extensions, tension is reduced whereas in other extensions, tension is instead increased. In particular, small total neutrino masses are favored and a total neutrino mass above 0.15 eV makes the tension “highly significant” (odds ∼1:150). A consequence of accepting this interpretation of the tension is that the degenerate neutrino hierarchy is highly disfavored by cosmological data and the direct hierarchy is slightly favored over the inverse.},

  Abstract                 = {The Time Renormalization Group (TRG) is an effective method for accurate calculations of the matter power spectrum at the scale of the first baryonic acoustic oscillations. By using a particular variable transformation in the TRG formalism, we can reduce the 2D integral in the source term of the equations of motion for the power spectrum into a series of 1D integrals. The shape of the integrand allows us to pre-compute only thirteen antiderivatives numerically, which can then be reused when evaluating the outer integral. While this introduces a few challenges to keep numerical noise under control, we find that the computation time for nonlinear corrections to the matter power spectrum decreases by a factor of 50. This opens up the possibility to use of TRG for mass production as in Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. A Fortran code demonstrating this new algorithm has been made publicly available.},

We find that our new approach gives results in excellent agreement when compared to the results from the actual data analysis of the clustering of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7 luminous red galaxies.

  Abstract                 = {We perform high resolution N-body simulations for f(R) gravity based on a self-adaptive particle- mesh code MLAPM. The Chameleon mechanism that recovers General Relativity on small scales is fully taken into account by self-consistently solving the non-linear equation for the scalar field. We independently confirm the previous simulation results, including the matter power spectrum, halo mass function and density profiles, obtained by Oyaizu et al. (Phys.Rev.D 78, 123524, 2008) and Schmidt et al. (Phys.Rev.D 79, 083518, 2009), and extend the resolution up to k{\textbackslash}textasciitilde20 h/Mpc for the measurement of the matter power spectrum. Based on our simulation results, we discuss how the Chameleon mechanism affects the clustering of dark matter and halos on full non-linear scales.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine the ability of the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model to simultaneously fit different types of cosmological observations and apply a recently proposed test, based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, to quantify the tension between different subsets of data. We find a tension between the distance indicators derived from a \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model using a combined dataset, and the recent \$H\_0\$ measurements, as well as the high redshift Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) obtained from the Lyman-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ forest spectra. We then allow for a dynamical dark energy (DE) and perform a Bayesian non-parametric reconstruction of the DE equation of state as a function of redshift. We find that the tension with \$H\_0\$ and Lyman-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ forest BAO is effectively relieved by a dynamical DE. Although a comparison of the Bayesian evidence for dynamical DE with that of \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM shows that the tension between the datasets is not sufficiently strong to support a model with more degrees of freedom, we find that an evolving DE is preferred at a \$3.5{\textbackslash}sigma\$ significance level based solely on the improvement in the fit. We also perform a forecast for the upcoming DESI survey and demonstrate that, if the current best fit DE happens to be the true model, it will be decisively supported by the Bayesian evidence.},
