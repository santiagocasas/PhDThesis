%Humans have been wondering about their place and purpose in the Universe since the beginning of history.
%It all started with the curiosity of looking at the stars in the night sky and at the processes of nature around us.
%The processes leading to the formation of the first stars, the first galaxies and then the first solar systems, are very complicated
%and posses a great degree of randomness. 
%There are many processes influencing the formation of these astrophysical objects and only a very 
%precise combination of conditions, allows planets to host life in the way we know it.
%Therefore, it is quite surprising that a species that formed in a small planet on a very typical galaxy, has been capable 
%to develop such an astonishing degree of sophistication in theoretical and observational techniques. 
%We are now able to investigate and explain the Universe from very small subatomic scales to 
%distances of billions of light-years.
Cosmology is a relatively new science, with less than 100 years of theoretical and observational development.
At the beginning, it was a very inexact discipline in physics, compared to other more established and observationally tested fields of research, like electromagnetism or statistical mechanics.
In the first years after Einstein crafted his theory of General Relativity (GR), other important theoretical and experimental physicists like Hubble, Slipher, Lema\^{\i}tre and Friedmann (for just naming a few) gave the first steps into discovering
that the Universe is a dynamical entity and that time and space might have had a well-defined beginning.

After that, the advances during the 20th century were exceptional. Many more galaxies, with many different morphologies were discovered,
and it was found that they were not just randomly located in space, but that they clustered into large and coherent structures. The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation was discovered, which gave us a picture of the early Universe and settled finally the question of the existence of a hot "Big Bang". Later on, galaxy rotation curves and galaxy cluster dynamics hinted strongly at the existence of a cold "Dark Matter" (CDM) component that interacts only gravitationally with common matter. Finally, towards the end of the century, Supernova observations confirmed that the Universe 
is experiencing an accelerated rate of expansion today, which might be explained
by introducing a Cosmological Constant ($\Lambda$) into Einstein's equations. 
By the turn of the century, the standard concordance
model of cosmology, also known as $\lcdm$, was already a well established theory.

In the last decade, cosmology has entered the so-called \emph{precision era}, and it is now a field of science that is driven by large amounts of data, which are able to constrain with very high precision the parameters of the cosmological model. In cosmology we are just able to observe electromagnetic radiation 
and how its wavelength is redshifted with time and space, plus the positions in the sky and the shapes of galaxies. Moreover we are not able to construct controlled laboratory experiments. Despite this limited window, we are able to measure very small effects that just few years ago were thought to be too difficult to be realized in practice, like Weak Lensing (WL), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Redshift Space Distortions (RSD), CMB polarization and many more.
Now with the newly discovered detection of gravitational waves a new window of gravitational wave astronomy has been opened and cosmologists are already thinking on how to use it to constrain even more the parameters of the Universe.

In this thesis we will deal with two topics in cosmology that have gained a lot of attention in recent years, the first one is the investigation of the possible extensions to the $\lcdm$ model or the modifications of standard Einstein's General Relativity. The second is the study of non-linear 
formation of large scale structures in the Universe. The first one has earned a lot of interest, since there is yet no successful explanation of the Cosmological Constant problem ---its measured value does not match the expectations from the particle physics point of view. 
The second topic is now of great importance, since present and future observations are capable of 
measuring more deeply into the non-linear regime of small scales. These scales contain a lot of information about the underlying cosmology and might hint at physics beyond the concordance model. Cosmological many-particle simulations and perturbation theory
have confirmed that these scales contain valuable information, 
but that extracting it is a very difficult task.

In the first half of \cref{chap:DE-MG-Overview}, 
we promptly review the needed formalism of General Relativity and
the standard cosmological $\lcdm$ scenario. We will explain why the Cosmological 
Constant is not completely satisfactory and finally we will derive the linearized
Einstein equations, which form the basis of cosmological structure formation theory.

In the second half of \cref{chap:DE-MG-Overview} we introduce the concepts of Dark Energy 
and Modified Gravity driven by a scalar field. We will divide the models into those in which the
scalar field is coupled universally to all particles in the Universe and models in which the scalar field is only coupled to specific particles, like Dark Matter or neutrinos. The models for which we will show results in this work are: Coupled Dark Energy, Growing Neutrino Quintessence, Effective Field Theories and
Horndeski models. We will also deal with parameterizations of Modified Gravity which are not connected
to any specific model.

In \cref{chap:Statistics} we explain the underlying concepts in statistics that will help us
make sense of the observations of galaxy surveys and non-linear structures in the Universe.
We detail the Bayesian approach to statistical inference and how we can forecast the results of future 
experiments using the Fisher Matrix formalism. This chapter includes details on the implementation
of a Fisher Matrix forecasting code developed by the author, which was used in the author's publications.

\Cref{chap:lin-nonlin-MG-forecasts} is a chapter based on a publication by the author with other collaborators, in which we study the effects of including or not, non-linear prescriptions on the constraints obtained for Modified Gravity parameterizations, by using future surveys. We also test the effect of changing the parameterization of the deviations to GR and we explore redshift-binned scenarios and the correlation between redshift-binned parameters.

The next investigation, detailed on \cref{chap:Fitting-CDE}, is also based on a publication and its purpose 
is to use results from N-body simulations in a specific model, namely Coupled Dark Energy, to improve 
previous forecasts on the coupling parameter governing a "fifth-force" interaction between CDM and 
the scalar field.

In \cref{chap:nonlinear} we elaborate on a technique called "eikonal Renormalized Perturbation Theory"
which is capable of yielding the non-linear matter power spectrum at mildly non-linear scales, by using resummation methods borrowed from Quantum Field Theory. 
We apply this method to a very general theory of gravity plus a scalar field, called Horndeski's theory, but we restrict ourselves to some special limiting cases, in order to  simplify the calculations. This  method
is be very promising, because it can improve the actual constraints on these Horndeski theories, which are based on just linear quantities.

Finally, in \cref{chap:GNQ} we present a quite different model of Dark Energy, called Growing Neutrino Quintessence. In this scenario, the masses of neutrinos are varying as a function of time and space, and are driven by the value of the Dark Energy scalar field. This yields very interesting phenomenological predictions, but also complicates the equations, such that a non-linear treatment including backreaction is needed. We perform our own (non-Newtonian) N-body simulations and find some interesting regions in parameter space, in which the evolution of the cosmological background is very similar to the standard $\lcdm$ scenario, but in which neutrinos form very large structures, so-called "lumps". This project has also been published
by the author and two collaborators in a scientific journal.

%In the conclusions chapter we summarize again the main results for each of the projects,
%we connect the concepts together and we give some hints at future work to do.
