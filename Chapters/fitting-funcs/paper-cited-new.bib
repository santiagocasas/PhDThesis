  abstract =      {We present the results of a large library of
                   cosmological N-body simulations, using power-law
                   initial spectra. The non-linear evolution of the
                   matter power spectra is compared with the predictions
                   of existing analytic scaling formulae based on the
                   work of Hamilton et al. The scaling approach has
                   assumed that highly non-linear structures obey
                   ‘stable clustering’ and are frozen in proper
                   coordinates. Our results show that, when transformed
                   under the self-similarity scaling, the scale-free
                   spectra define a non-linear locus that is clearly
                   shallower than would be required under stable
                   clustering. Furthermore, the small-scale non-linear
                   power increases as both the power spectrum index n
                   and the density parameter Ω decrease, and this
                   evolution is not well accounted for by the previous
                   scaling formulae. This breakdown of stable clustering
                   can be understood as resulting from the modification
                   of dark matter haloes by continuing mergers. These
                   effects are naturally included in the analytic
                   ‘halo model’ for non-linear structure; we use
                   this approach to fit both our scale-free results and
                   also our previous cold dark matter data. This method
                   is more accurate than the commonly used
                   Peacock–Dodds formula and should be applicable to
                   more general power spectra. Code to evaluate
                   non-linear power spectra using this method is
                   available from
  http://as1.chem.nottingham.ac.uk/{\textbackslash}textasciitilderes/software.html.
  Following publication, we will make the power-law simulation data publically
  available through the Virgo website http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/Virgo/.},

  abstract =      {Based on a suite of state-of-the-art high-resolution
                   \$N\$-body simulations, we revisit the so-called
                   halofit model (Smith et al. 2003) as an accurate
                   fitting formula for the nonlinear matter power
                   spectrum. While the halofit model has been frequently
                   used as a standard cosmological tool to predict the
                   nonlinear matter power spectrum in a universe
                   dominated by cold dark matter, its precision has been
                   limited by the low-resolution of \$N\$-body
                   simulations used to determine the fitting parameters,
                   suggesting the necessity of improved fitting formula
                   at small scales for future cosmological studies. We
                   run high-resolution \$N\$-body simulations for 16
                   cosmological models around the Wilkinson Microwave
                   Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) best-fit cosmological
                   parameters (1, 3, 5, and 7 year results), including
                   dark energy models with a constant equation of state.
                   The simulation results are used to re-calibrate the
                   fitting parameters of the halofit model so as to
                   reproduce small-scale power spectra of the \$N\$-body
                   simulations, while keeping the precision at large
                   scales. The revised fitting formula provides an
                   accurate prediction of the nonlinear matter power
                   spectrum in a wide range of wavenumber (\$k

                   matter fluctuations using Artificial Neural Network
                   (PkANN). We present a new approach to confront
                   small-scale non-linearities in the power spectrum of
                   matter fluctuations. This ever-present and pernicious
                   uncertainty is often the Achilles' heel in
                   cosmological studies and must be reduced if we are to
                   see the advent of precision cosmology in the
                   late-time Universe. We show that an optimally trained
                   artificial neural network (ANN), when presented with
                   a set of cosmological parameters (Omega\_m
                   h{\textasciicircum}2, Omega\_b h{\textasciicircum}2,
                   n\_s, w\_0, sigma\_8, m\_nu and redshift z), can
                   provide a worst-case error {\textless}=1 per cent
                   (for z{\textless}=2) fit to the non-linear matter
                   power spectrum deduced through N-body simulations,
                   for modes up to k{\textless}=0.7 h/Mpc. Our power
                   spectrum interpolator is accurate over the entire
                   parameter space. This is a significant improvement
                   over some of the current matter power spectrum
                   calculators. In this paper, we detail how an accurate
                   interpolation of the matter power spectrum is
                   achievable with only a sparsely sampled grid of
                   cosmological parameters. Unlike large-scale N-body
                   simulations which are computationally expensive
                   and/or infeasible, a well-trained ANN can be an
                   extremely quick and reliable tool in interpreting
                   cosmological observations and parameter estimation.
                   This paper is the first in a series. In this method
                   paper, we generate the non-linear matter power
                   spectra using HaloFit and use them as mock
                   observations to train the ANN. This work sets the
                   foundation for Paper II, where a suite of N-body
                   simulations will be used to compute the non-linear
                   matter power spectra at sub-per cent accuracy, in the
                   quasi-non-linear regime 0.1 h/Mpc {\textless}= k
                   {\textless}= 0.9 h/Mpc. A trained ANN based on this
                   N-body suite will be released for the scientific
                   community.},

                   matter power spectrum, constructed using Artificial
                   Neural Networks (ANNs). Previously, using Halofit to

                   we train ANNs to predict the power spectrum over the

  PkANN is faster than computationally expensive N-body simulations, yet
  provides a worst-case error \${\textless}1\$ per cent fit to the non-linear
  matter power spectrum deduced through N-body simulations. The overall
  precision of PkANN is set by the accuracy of our N-body simulations, at 5 per
  cent level for cosmological models with \${\textbackslash}sum
  m\_{\textbackslash}nu{\textless}0.5\$ eV for all redshifts
  \$z{\textbackslash}leq2\$. For models with \${\textbackslash}sum

                   massive neutrinos on the power spectrum. In the
                   strongly non-linear regime HALOFIT systematically
                   over-predicts the suppression due to the
                   free-streaming of the neutrinos. The maximal
                   discrepancy occurs at k

                   the level of 10\% of the total suppression. Most
                   published constraints on neutrino masses based on
                   HALOFIT are not affected, as they rely on data

  reproduces the simulations remarkably well. In contrast, we show that one
  needs an N-body simulation volume of more than 1000

  1 per cent accuracy on covariance matrix. We investigate the supersample

  amplitude to about 0.2 per cent for a survey volume of
  1(Gpc h{\textasciicircum}−1){\textasciicircum}3, compared to
  0.4 per cent otherwise. We explore the sensitivity of these coefficients
  to baryonic effects using hydrodynamic simulations of van Daalen et al. We
  find that because of baryons redistributing matter inside haloes all the
  coefficients A2n for n {\textgreater} 0 are strongly affected by baryonic
  effects, while A0 remains almost unchanged, a consequence of halo mass
  conservation. Our results suggest that observations such as weak lensing
  power spectrum can be effectively marginalized over the baryonic effects,

  A0 and Zeldovich terms.},

                   evolution in the growth of large-scale structure, by
                   following the dynamics of gravitational clustering as
                   it builds up in time. This approach is conveniently
                   represented by Feynman diagrams constructed in terms
                   of three objects: the initial conditions (e.g.
                   perturbation spectrum), the vertex (describing
                   nonlinearities) and the propagator (describing linear
                   evolution). We show that loop corrections to the
                   linear power spectrum organize themselves into two
                   classes of diagrams: one corresponding to
                   mode-coupling effects, the other to a renormalization
                   of the propagator. Resummation of the latter gives
                   rise to a quantity that measures the memory of
                   perturbations to initial conditions as a function of
                   scale. As a result of this, we show that a
                   well-defined (renormalized) perturbation theory
                   follows, in the sense that each term in the remaining
                   mode-coupling series dominates at some characteristic
                   scale and is subdominant otherwise. This is unlike
                   standard perturbation theory, where different loop
                   corrections can become of the same magnitude in the
                   nonlinear regime. In companion papers we compare the
                   resummation of the propagator with numerical
                   simulations, and apply these results to the
                   calculation of the nonlinear power spectrum.
                   Remarkably, the expressions in renormalized
                   perturbation theory can be written in a way that
                   closely resembles the halo model.},

  abstract =      {The universe is smooth on large scales but very
                   inhomogeneous on small scales. Why is the spacetime
                   on large scales modeled to a good approximation by
                   the Friedmann equations? Are we sure that small-scale
                   non-linearities do not induce a large backreaction?
                   Related to this, what is the effective theory that
                   describes the universe on large scales? In this paper
                   we make progress in addressing these questions. We
                   show that the effective theory for the
                   long-wavelength universe behaves as a viscous fluid
                   coupled to gravity: integrating out short-wavelength
                   perturbations renormalizes the homogeneous background
                   and introduces dissipative dynamics into the
                   evolution of long-wavelength perturbations. The
                   effective fluid has small perturbations and is
                   characterized by a few parameters like an equation of
                   state, a sound speed and a viscosity parameter. These
                   parameters can be matched to numerical simulations or
                   fitted from observations. We find that the
                   backreaction of small-scale non-linearities is very
                   small, being suppressed by the large hierarchy
                   between the scale of non-linearities and the horizon
                   scale. The effective pressure of the fluid is always
                   positive and much too small to significantly affect
                   the background evolution. Moreover, we prove that
                   virialized scales decouple completely from the
                   large-scale dynamics, at all orders in the
                   post-Newtonian expansion. We propose that our
                   effective theory be used to formulate a well-defined
                   and controlled alternative to conventional
                   perturbation theory, and we discuss possible
                   observational applications. Finally, our way of
                   reformulating results in second-order perturbation
                   theory in terms of a long-wavelength effective fluid
                   provides the opportunity to understand non-linear
                   effects in a simple and physically intuitive way.},

                   coupled to dark energy (DE), through N-body
                   simulations. The dark-dark coupling introduces two
                   novel effects in particle dynamics: (i) DM particle
                   masses vary with time; (ii) gravity between DM
                   particles is ruled by a constant G*, greater than
                   Newton’s constant G, holding in other two-body
                   interactions. Hence, DM particle dynamics violates
                   the equivalence principle and, as a consequence,
                   baryons and DM particle distributions develop a large
                   scale bias. Here we focus on DE models with
                   Ratra-Peebles (RP) potentials. The dark-dark coupling
                   is set in a parametric range compatible with
                   background and linear dynamics. We find that
                   nonlinear dynamics puts additional constraints on the
                   coupling parameter. They mostly arise from cluster
                   density profiles that we find to yield higher
                   concentrations in coupled RP models, with respect to
                   (uncoupled) dynamical DE cosmologies. Such an
                   enhancement, although being a strong effect in some
                   coupling parameter range, leads to acceptable
                   observables for a significant range of values of the
                   coupling parameter. We also analyze the expected
                   cluster mass function and the DM-baryon bias in
                   nonlinear conditions, finding them compatible with
                   data. With the above restrictions, coupled DE models
                   with a RP potential are therefore consistent with
                   cosmological nonlinear observables. As a general
                   conclusion, we confirm that cosmologies with a
                   suitable dark-dark coupling are viable theories.},

  {\textbackslash}textbackslashemph\{sheets\},
  {\textbackslash}textbackslashemph\{filaments\} and
  {\textbackslash}textbackslashemph\{knots\} depending on the eigenvalues of
  the velocity shear tensor, which are an excellent proxy for the underlying
  overdensity distribution. We find that the properties of objects classified
  according to their surrounding environment shows a substantial dependence on
  the underlying cosmology; for example, while
  \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm max\}\$ shows average deviations of
  \${\textbackslash}textbackslashapprox5\$ per cent across the different models
  when considering the full halo sample, comparing objects classified according
  to their environment, the size of the deviation can be as large as \$20\$ per
  cent. We also find that halo spin parameters are positively correlated to the
  coupling, whereas halo concentrations show the opposite behaviour.
  Furthermore, when studying the concentration-mass relation in different
  environments, we find that in all cosmologies underdense regions have a
  larger normalization and a shallower slope. While this behaviour is found to
  characterize all the models, differences in the best-fit relations are

  abstract =      {We present the largest set of N-body and
                   hydrodynamical simulations to date for cosmological
                   models featuring a direct interaction between the
                   dark energy (DE) scalar field, responsible for the
                   observed cosmic acceleration, and the cold dark
                   matter (CDM) fluid. With respect to previous works,
                   our simulations considerably extend the statistical
                   significance of the simulated volume and cover a
                   wider range of different realizations of the
                   interacting DE scenario, including the recently
                   proposed bouncing coupled DE model. Furthermore, all
                   the simulations are normalized in order to be
                   consistent with the present bounds on the amplitude
                   of density perturbations at last scattering, thereby
                   providing the first realistic determination of the
                   effects of a DE coupling for cosmological growth
                   histories fully compatible with the latest cosmic
                   microwave background data. As a first basic analysis,
                   we have studied the impact of the coupling on the
                   non-linear matter power spectrum and on the bias
                   between the CDM and baryon distributions, as a
                   function of redshift and scale. For the former, we
                   have addressed the issue of the degeneracy between
                   the effects of the coupling and other standard
                   cosmological parameters, e.g. σ8, showing how the
                   redshift evolution of the linear amplitude or the
                   scale dependence of the non-linear power spectrum
                   might provide a way to break the degeneracy. For the
                   latter, instead, we have computed the redshift and
                   scale dependence of the bias in all our different
                   models showing how a growing coupling or a bouncing
                   coupled DE scenario provides much stronger effects
                   with respect to constant coupling models.
                   Furthermore, we discuss the main features imprinted
                   by the DE interactions on the halo and subhalo mass
                   functions. We refer to this vast numerical initiative

  abstract =      {We evaluate the mass function of virialized halos, by
                   using Press \& Schechter (PS) and/or Steth \& Tormen
                   (ST) expressions, for cosmologies where Dark Energy
                   (DE) is due to a scalar self-interacting field,
                   coupled with Dark Matter (DM). We keep to coupled DE
                   (cDE) models known to fit linear observables. To
                   implement the PS-ST approach, we start from reviewing
                   and extending the results of a previous work on the
                   growth of a spherical top-hat fluctuation in cDE
                   models, confirming their most intriguing
                   astrophysical feature, i.e. a significant baryon-DM
                   segregation, occurring well before the onset of any
                   hydrodynamical effect. Accordingly, the predicted
                   mass function depends on how halo masses are
                   measured. For any option, however, the coupling
                   causes a distortion of the mass function, still at
                   z=0. Furthermore, the z-dependence of cDE mass
                   functions is mostly displaced, in respect to
                   LambdaCDM, in the opposite way of uncoupled dynamical
                   DE. This is an aspect of the basic underlying result,
                   that even a little DM-DE coupling induces relevant
                   modifications in the non-linear evolution. Therefore,
                   without causing great shifts in linear astrophysical
                   observables, the DM-baryon segregation induced by the
                   coupling can have an impact on a number of
                   cosmological problems, it e.g., galaxy satellite
                   abundance, spiral disk formation, apparent baryon
                   shortage, entropy input in clusters, etc..},

                   Baldi et al. and show that when linear and non-linear
                   effects of the interaction between dark energy and
                   cold dark matter are properly disentangled, the

                   acting at non-linear scales and in particular is the

                   that a direct interaction between Dark Energy (DE)

                   Halo Mass Function (HMF) of groups and clusters of

                   the \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashsmall CoDECS\}
                   simulations, we derive the HMF for several different
                   types of coupled DE scenarios both based on the FoF
                   algorithm and on the SO halo identification for
                   different values of the overdensity threshold
                   \${\textbackslash}textbackslashDelta\_\{c\}\$. We
                   compare the computed HMFs for coupled DE cosmologies
                   with \${\textbackslash}textbackslashLambda \$CDM as
                   well as with the predictions of the standard analytic
                   fitting functions. Our results show that the standard
                   fitting functions still reproduce reasonably well
                   both the FoF and the SO HMFs of interacting DE
                   cosmologies at intermediate masses and at low
                   redshifts, once rescaled to the characteristic
                   amplitude of linear density perturbations of each
                   specific model as given by
                   \${\textbackslash}textbackslashsigma\_\{8\}\$.
                   However, we also find that such apparent degeneracy
                   with \${\textbackslash}textbackslashsigma\_\{8\}\$ is
                   broken both by the high-mass tail and by the redshift
                   evolution of our HMFs, with deviations beyond
                   \${\textbackslash}textbackslashsim 10\%\$ for most of
                   the models under investigation. Furthermore, the
                   discrepancy with respect to the predictions of
                   standard fitting functions rescaled with the
                   characteristic value of
                   \${\textbackslash}textbackslashsigma\_\{8\}\$ shows
                   – for some models – a strong dependence on the
                   spherical overdensity threshold
                   \${\textbackslash}textbackslashDelta\_\{c\}\$ used
                   for the halo identification. We find that such effect
                   is due to a significant increase of halo
                   concentration at low redshifts in these models, that
                   is however absent in the majority of the cosmological
                   scenarios considered in this work. We can therefore
                   conclude that the universality of the HMF is violated
                   by cosmological models that feature a direct
                   interaction between DE and CDM.},

                   find that coupling produces a population of
                   significantly larger voids, possibly explaining the
                   recent result of Tavasoli et al. (2013). In addition,

                   and density profile shape, finding that the coupling

                   the Hubble constant, as well as from baryon acoustic
                   oscillations and supernovae Ia, we find
                   \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashbeta\}
                   {\textbackslash}textless 0.050(0.074). In this case
                   we also find an interesting likelihood peak for
                   \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashbeta\} = 0.041 (still
                   compatible with 0 at
                   1\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashsigma\}). This peak
                   comes mostly from a slight difference between the
                   Hubble parameter HST result and the WMAP7+SPT best
                   fit. Finally, we show that forecasts of Planck+SPT
                   mock data can pin down the coupling to a precision of
                   better than 1\% and detect whether the marginal peak
                   we find at small non zero coupling is a real effect.},

                   of dark energy (DE) and modified gravity (MG), beyond
                   the cosmological constant scenario. We start with
                   cases where the DE only directly affects the
                   background evolution, considering Taylor expansions
                   of the equation of state, principal component
                   analysis and parameterizations related to the
                   potential of a minimally coupled DE scalar field.
                   When estimating the density of DE at early times, we
                   significantly improve present constraints. We then
                   move to general parameterizations of the DE or MG
                   perturbations that encompass both effective field
                   theories and the phenomenology of gravitational
                   potentials in MG models. Lastly, we test a range of
                   specific models, such as k-essence, f(R) theories and
                   coupled DE. In addition to the latest Planck data,
                   for our main analyses we use baryonic acoustic
                   oscillations, type-Ia supernovae and local
                   measurements of the Hubble constant. We further show
                   the impact of measurements of the cosmological
                   perturbations, such as redshift-space distortions and
                   weak gravitational lensing. These additional probes
                   are important tools for testing MG models and for
                   breaking degeneracies that are still present in the
                   combination of Planck and background data sets. All
                   results that include only background
                   parameterizations are in agreement with LCDM. When
                   testing models that also change perturbations (even
                   when the background is fixed to LCDM), some tensions
                   appear in a few scenarios: the maximum one found is
                   {\textbackslash}sim 2 sigma for Planck TT+lowP when
                   parameterizing observables related to the
                   gravitational potentials with a chosen time
                   dependence; the tension increases to at most 3 sigma
                   when external data sets are included. It however
                   disappears when including CMB lensing.},

                   will use cosmological probes to investigate the

                   tracking their observational signatures on the
                   geometry of the universe and on the cosmic history of
                   structure formation. The mission is optimised for two
                   independent primary cosmological probes: Weak
                   gravitational Lensing (WL) and Baryonic Acoustic
                   Oscillations (BAO). The Euclid payload consists of a
                   1.2 m Korsch telescope designed to provide a large
                   field of view. It carries two instruments with a
                   common field-of-view of {\textasciitilde}0.54 deg2:
                   the visual imager (VIS) and the near infrared
                   instrument (NISP) which contains a slitless
                   spectrometer and a three bands photometer. The Euclid
                   wide survey will cover 15,000 deg2 of the
                   extragalactic sky and is complemented by two 20 deg2
                   deep fields. For WL, Euclid measures the shapes of
                   30-40 resolved galaxies per arcmin2 in one broad
                   visible R+I+Z band (550-920 nm). The photometric
                   redshifts for these galaxies reach a precision of
                   dz/(1+z) {\textless} 0.05. They are derived from
                   three additional Euclid NIR bands (Y, J, H in the
                   range 0.92-2.0 micron), complemented by ground based
                   photometry in visible bands derived from public data
                   or through engaged collaborations. The BAO are
                   determined from a spectroscopic survey with a
                   redshift accuracy dz/(1+z) =0.001. The slitless

  abstract =      {(Abridged) The 7-year WMAP data and improved
                   astrophysical data rigorously test the standard
                   cosmological model and its extensions. By combining
                   WMAP with the latest distance measurements from BAO
                   and H0 measurement, we determine the parameters of
                   the simplest LCDM model. The power-law index of the
                   primordial power spectrum is n\_s=0.968+-0.012, a
                   measurement that excludes the scale-invariant
                   spectrum by 99.5\%CL. The other parameters are also
                   improved from the 5-year results. Notable examples of
                   improved parameters are the total mass of neutrinos,
                   sum(m\_nu){\textless}0.58eV, and the effective number
                   of neutrino species, N\_eff=4.34+0.86-0.88. We detect
                   the effect of primordial helium on the temperature
                   power spectrum and provide a new test of big bang
                   nucleosynthesis. We detect, and show on the map for
                   the first time, the tangential and radial
                   polarization patterns around hot and cold spots of
                   temperature fluctuations, an important test of
                   physical processes at z=1090 and the dominance of
                   adiabatic scalar fluctuations. With the 7-year TB
                   power spectrum, the limit on a rotation of the
                   polarization plane due to potential parity-violating
                   effects has improved to
                   Delta(alpha)=-1.1+-1.4(stat)+-1.5(syst) degrees. We
                   report significant detections of the SZ effect at the
                   locations of known clusters of galaxies. The measured
                   SZ signal agrees well with the expected signal from
                   the X-ray data. However, it is a factor of 0.5 to 0.7
                   times the predictions from "universal profile" of
                   Arnaud et al., analytical models, and hydrodynamical
                   simulations. We find, for the first time in the SZ
                   effect, a significant difference between the
                   cooling-flow and non-cooling-flow clusters (or
                   relaxed and non-relaxed clusters), which can explain
                   some of the discrepancy. This lower amplitude is
                   consistent with the lower-than-theoretically-expected
                   SZ power spectrum recently measured by the South Pole
                   Telescope collaboration.},

  abstract =      {Semi-analytical methods, based on Eulerian
                   perturbation theory, are a promising tool to follow
                   the time evolution of cosmological perturbations at
                   small redshifts and at mildly nonlinear scales. All
                   these schemes are based on two approximations: the
                   existence of a smoothing scale and the single-stream
                   approximation, where velocity dispersion of the dark
                   matter fluid, as well as higher moments of the
                   particle distributions, are neglected. Despite being
                   widely recognized, these two assumptions are, in
                   principle, incompatible, since any finite smoothing
                   scale gives rise to velocity dispersion and higher
                   moments at larger scales. We describe a new approach
                   to perturbation theory, where the Vlasov and fluid
                   equations are derived in presence of a finite
                   coarse-graining scale: this allows a clear separation
                   between long and short distance modes and leads to a
                   hybrid approach where the former are treated
                   perturbatively and the effect of the latter is
                   encoded in external source terms for velocity,
                   velocity dispersion, and all the higher order
                   moments, which can be computed from N-body
                   simulations. We apply the coarse-grained perturbation
                   theory to the computation of the power spectrum and
                   the cross-spectrum between density and velocity
                   dispersion, and compare the results with N-body
                   simulations, finding good agreement.},

                   universe. We use a total of 5000 cosmological N-body
                   simulations to study in detail the distribution of
                   best-fit cosmological parameters and the baryon
                   acoustic peak positions. The obtained distribution is
                   compared with the results from the Fisher matrix
                   analysis with and without including non-Gaussian
                   errors. For the Fisher matrix analysis, we compute
                   the derivatives of the matter power spectrum with
                   respect to cosmological parameters using directly
                   full nonlinear simulations. We show that the
                   non-Gaussian errors increase the unmarginalized
                   errors by up to a factor 5 for k\_\{max\}=0.4h/Mpc if

                   fitting, the impact of the non-Gaussian errors is
                   significantly mitigated due to severe parameter
                   degeneracies in the power spectrum. The distribution
                   of the acoustic peak positions is well described by a

                   consistent with the statistical interval predicted
                   from the Fisher matrix. We also examine systematic
                   bias in the best-fit parameter due to the
                   non-Gaussian errors. The bias is found to be smaller
                   than the 1 sigma statistical error for both the

  abstract =      {Standard cosmological perturbation theory (SPT) for
                   the Large Scale Structure (LSS) of the Universe fails
                   at small scales (UV) due to strong nonlinearities and
                   to multistreaming effects. In Pietroni et al. 2011 a
                   new framework was proposed in which the large scales
                   (IR) are treated perturbatively while the information
                   on the UV, mainly small scale velocity dispersion, is
                   obtained by nonlinear methods like N-body
                   simulations. Here we develop this approach, showing
                   that it is possible to reproduce the fully nonlinear
                   power spectrum (PS) by combining a simple (and fast)
                   1-loop computation for the IR scales and the
                   measurement of a single, dominant, correlator from
                   N-body simulations for the UV ones. We measure this
                   correlator for a suite of seven different
                   cosmologies, and we show that its inclusion in our
                   perturbation scheme reproduces the fully non-linear
                   PS with percent level accuracy, for wave numbers up
                   to \$k{\textbackslash}sim 0.4{\textbackslash},
                   h{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm
                   Mpc{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ down to \$z=0\$. We
                   then show that, once this correlator has been
                   measured in a given cosmology, there is no need to
                   run a new simulation for a different cosmology in the
                   suite. Indeed, by rescaling this correlator by a
                   proper function computable in SPT, the reconstruction
                   procedure works also for the other cosmologies and
                   for all redshifts, with comparable accuracy. Finally,
                   we clarify the relation of this approach to the
                   Effective Field Theory methods recently proposed in
                   the LSS context.},

                   This agrees remarkably well with the exponential

                   P(k) require a data analysis pipeline that is both
                   fast enough to be computationally feasible and
                   accurate enough to take full advantage of
                   high-quality data. We present a rigorous discussion
                   of different methods of power spectrum estimation,
                   with emphasis on the traditional Fourier method, the
                   linear (Karhunen-Loeve; KL), and quadratic data
                   compression schemes, showing in what approximations
                   they give the same result. To improve speed, we show
                   how many of the advantages of KL data compression and
                   power spectrum estimation may be achieved with a
                   computationally faster quadratic method. To improve
                   accuracy, we derive analytic expressions for handling
                   the integral constraint, since it is crucial that
                   finite volume effects are accurately corrected for on
                   scales comparable to the depth of the survey. We also
                   show that for the KL and quadratic techniques,
                   multiple constraints can be included via simple
                   matrix operations, thereby rendering the results less
                   sensitive to galactic extinction and mis-estimates of
                   the radial selection function. We present a data
                   analysis pipeline that we argue does justice to the
                   increases in both quality and quantity of data that
                   upcoming redshift surveys will provide. It uses three
                   analysis techniques in conjunction: a traditional
                   Fourier approach on small scales, a pixelized
                   quadratic matrix method on large scales and a
                   pixelized KL eigenmode analysis to probe anisotropic
                   effects such as redshift-space distortions.},

                   formalism that is upgraded from Seo \& Eisenstein
                   (2003). We isolate the information from the baryonic
                   peaks by excluding distance information from other
                   less robust sources. Meanwhile we accommodate the
                   Lagrangian displacement distribution into the Fisher
                   matrix calculation to reflect the gradual loss of
                   information in scale and in time due to nonlinear
                   growth, nonlinear bias, and nonlinear redshift

                   2-dimensional or even 1-dimensional formalism with

                   cosmological N-body simulations aimed at
                   investigating possible systematic errors in the
                   recovery of cosmological distances. We show the

                   While mildly biased tracers follow the matter power

                   the intervening large-scale structure and photometric
                   redshift errors as additional sources of noise, and a
                   maximum likelihood method for applying the test is
                   presented. Decomposing the lensing matter
                   distribution into dark matter haloes we calculate the
                   parameter covariance matrix for an arbitrary
                   experiment. Combining with the expected results from
                   the cosmic microwave background (CMB) we design an
                   optimal survey for probing dark energy. This shows
                   that a targeted survey imaging 60 of the largest
                   clusters in a hemisphere with five-band optical
                   photometric redshifts to a median galaxy depth of zm=
                   0.9 could measure w0≡w(z= 0) to a marginal 1σ
                   error of Δw0= 0.5. We marginalize over all other
                   parameters including wa, where the equation of state
                   is parametrized in terms of scalefactor a as w(a)
                   =w0+wa(1 −a). For higher accuracy a large-scale
                   photometric redshift survey is required, where the
                   largest gain in signal arises from the numerous
                   ≈1014 M⊙ haloes corresponding to medium-sized
                   galaxy clusters. Combined with the expected Planck
                   Surveyor results, such a near-future five-band survey
                   covering 10 000 deg2 to zm= 0.7 could measure w0 to
                   Δw0= 0.075 and Δwa= 0.33. A stronger combined
                   constraint is put on w measured at the pivot redshift
                   zp= 0.27 of Δw(zp) = 0.0298. We compare and combine
                   the geometric test with the cosmological and dark
                   energy parameters measured from planned baryon
                   acoustic oscillation (BAO) and supernova Type Ia
                   experiments, and find that the geometric test results
                   combine with a significant reduction in errors due to
                   different degeneracies. A combination of geometric
                   lensing, CMB and BAO experiments could achieve Δw0=
                   0.047 and Δwa= 0.111 with a pivot redshift
                   constraint of Δw(zp) = 0.020 at zp= 0.62. Simple
                   relations are presented that show how our lensing
                   results can be scaled to other telescope classes and
                   survey parameters.},

                   z = 0.1 and z = 1 with different luminosity

                   (2010), the most sophisticated one considered in this
                   analysis, provides in general the most unbiased
                   estimates of the growth rate of structure, with
                   systematic errors within 4\% over a wide range of
                   galaxy populations spanning luminosities between L

                   power spectrum gives rise to an unphysical
                   distribution of pairwise velocities, and show that it
                   is in general impossible to derive the distribution
                   from measurements of redshift-space clustering.
                   Methods that claim to do this obtain instead
                   something else, whose properties we derive. We
                   provide a general derivation of the large-scale limit
                   of the redshift-space power spectrum and show that it

                   on Gaussian and non-Gaussian contributions to the

                   show that the large-scale evolution of velocity
                   fields is not well described by linear theory and
                   discuss how this impacts the redshift-space power

                   of the redshift-space power as an indicator of the
                   real-space power spectrum shape can lead to
                   systematic effects in the determination of
                   cosmological parameters; nevertheless a simple
                   procedure is able to recover the large-scale

                   importance for accurately modeling baryon acoustic
                   oscillations (BAOs). Contrary to the models of
                   redshift distortion phenomenologically introduced but
                   frequently used in the literature, the new model
                   includes the corrections arising from the nonlinear
                   coupling between the density and velocity fields
                   associated with two competitive effects of redshift
                   distortion, i.e., Kaiser and Finger-of-God effects.
                   Based on the improved treatment of perturbation

                   model predictions with the monopole and quadrupole
                   power spectra of N-body simulations, and an excellent
                   agreement is achieved over the scales of BAOs.
                   Potential impacts on constraining dark energy and
                   modified gravity from the redshift-space power
                   spectrum are also investigated based on the
                   Fisher-matrix formalism, particularly focusing on the
                   measurements of the Hubble parameter, angular
                   diameter distance, and growth rate for structure
                   formation. We find that the existing phenomenological
                   models of redshift distortion produce a systematic
                   error on measurements of the angular diameter
                   distance and Hubble parameter by 1\%–2\% , and the
                   growth-rate parameter by ∼5\%, which would become
                   non-negligible for future galaxy surveys. Correctly
                   modeling redshift distortion is thus essential, and
                   the new prescription for the redshift-space power
                   spectrum including the nonlinear corrections can be
                   used as an accurate theoretical template for

                   cameras and spectrographs. The primary science goal
                   of such surveys is to constrain the nature of the
                   dark energy by measuring the large-scale structure of
                   the Universe. This requires a tracer of the
                   underlying dark matter which maximizes the useful
                   volume of the survey. We investigate two potential
                   survey selection methods: an emission line sample
                   based on the {\textbackslash}ha line and a sample
                   selected in the H-band. We present predictions for
                   the abundance and clustering of such galaxies, using
                   two published versions of the {\textbackslash}galform
                   galaxy formation model. Our models predict that
                   {\textbackslash}ha selected galaxies tend to avoid
                   massive dark matter haloes and instead trace the
                   surrounding filamentary structure; H-band selected
                   galaxies, on the other hand, are found in the highest
                   mass haloes. This has implications for the
                   measurement of the rate at which fluctuations grow
                   due to gravitational instability. We use mock

                   \$H\_\{{\textbackslash}rm AB\}=22\$ samples an
                   effective volume that is \${\textbackslash}sim 5-10\$
                   times larger than that probed by an
                   {\textbackslash}ha survey with
                   \${\textbackslash}logfha {\textgreater} -15.4\$; a
                   flux limit of at least \${\textbackslash}logfha =
                   -16\$ is required for an {\textbackslash}ha sample to
                   become competitive in effective volume.},
