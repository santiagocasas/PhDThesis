	abstract = {Growing neutrino quintessence describes a form of dynamical dark energy that could explain why dark energy dominates the universe only in recent cosmological times. This scenario predicts the formation of large-scale neutrino lumps which could allow for observational tests. We perform for the first time N-body simulations of the non-linear growth of structures for cold dark matter (CDM) and neutrino fluids in the context of growing neutrino cosmologies. Our analysis shows a pulsation increase and subsequent decrease in the neutrino density contrast. This could lead to interesting observational signatures, as an enhanced bulk flow in a situation where the DM density contrast differs only very mildly from the standard ΛCDM scenario. We also determine for the first time the statistical distribution of neutrino lumps as a function of mass at different redshifts. Such determination provides an essential ingredient for a realistic estimate of the observational signatures of growing neutrino cosmologies. Due to a breakdown of the non-relativistic Newtonian approximation, our results are limited to redshifts z≥ 1.},

	abstract = {We present a systematic treatment of the linear theory of scalar gravitational perturbations in the synchronous gauge and the conformal Newtonian (or longitudinal) gauge. We first derive the transformation law relating the two gauges. We then write down in parallel in both gauges the coupled, linearized Boltzmann, Einstein and fluid equations that govern the evolution of the metric perturbations and the density fluctuations of the particle species. The particle species considered include cold dark matter (CDM), baryons, photons, massless neutrinos, and massive neutrinos (a hot dark matter or HDM candidate), where the CDM and baryon components are treated as fluids while a detailed phase-space description is given to the photons and neutrinos. The linear evolution equations presented are applicable to any \${\textbackslash}Omega=1\$ model with CDM or a mixture of CDM and HDM. Isentropic initial conditions on super-horizon scales are derived. The equations are solved numerically in both gauges for a CDM+HDM model with \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cold\}=0.65,\$ \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm hot\}=0.3\$, and \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm baryon\}=0.05\$. We discuss the evolution of the metric and the density perturbations and compare their different behaviors outside the horizon in the two gauges. In a companion paper we integrate the geodesic equations for the neutrino particles in the perturbed conformal Newtonian background metric computed here. The purpose is to obtain an accurate sampling of the neutrino phase space for the HDM initial conditions in \$N\$-body simulations of the CDM+HDM models.},

	abstract = {Recent constrains on the sum of neutrino masses inferred by analyzing cosmological data, show that detecting a non-zero neutrino mass is within reach of forthcoming cosmological surveys, implying a direct determination of the absolute neutrino mass scale. The measurement relies on constraining the shape of the matter power spectrum below the neutrino free streaming scale: massive neutrinos erase power at these scales. Detection of a lack of small-scale power, however, could also be due to a host of other effects. It is therefore of paramount importance to validate neutrinos as the source of power suppression at small scales. We show that, independent on hierarchy, neutrinos always show a footprint on large, linear scales; the exact location and properties can be related to the measured power suppression (an astrophysical measurement) and atmospheric neutrinos mass splitting (a neutrino oscillation experiment measurement). This feature can not be easily mimicked by systematic uncertainties or modifications in the cosmological model. The measurement of such a feature, up to 1\% relative change in the power spectrum, is a smoking gun for confirming the determination of the absolute neutrino mass scale from cosmological observations. It also demonstrates the synergy of astrophysics and particle physics experiments.},

	abstract = {We highlight a viable mechanism leading to the formation of dark energy structures on sub-horizon cosmological scales, starting from linear perturbations in scalar-tensor cosmologies. We show that the coupling of the dark energy scalar field, or Quintessence, to the Ricci scalar induces a "dragging" of its density perturbations through the general relativistic gravitational potentials. We discuss, in particular, how this process forces dark energy to behave as a pressureless component if the cosmic evolution is dominated by non-relativistic matter. This property is also analyzed in terms of the effective sound speed of the dark energy, which correspondingly approaches the behavior of the dominant cosmological component, being effectively vanishing after matter-radiation equality. To illustrate this effect, we consider Extended Quintessence scenarios involving a quadratic coupling between the field and the Ricci scalar. We show that Quintessence density perturbations reach non-linearity at scales and redshifts relevant for the structure formation process, respecting all the existing constraints on scalar-tensor theories of Gravity. This study opens new perspectives on the standard picture of structure formation in dark energy cosmologies, since the Quintessence field itself, if non-minimally coupled to Gravity, may undergo clustering processes, eventually forming density perturbations exiting from the linear regime. A non-linear approach is then required to further investigate the evolution of these structures, and in particular their role in the dark haloes surrounding galaxies and clusters.},

Motivated by these considerations, we present the computation of the non-linear power spectrum of ΛCDM models in the presence of massive neutrinos using the Renormalization Group (RG) time-flow approach, which amounts to a resummation of perturbative corrections to the matter power spectrum to all orders. We compare our results with those obtained with other methods, i.e. linear theory, one-loop perturbation theory and N-body simulations and show that the time-RG method improves the one-loop method in fitting the N-body data, especially in determining the suppression of the matter power spectrum when neutrino are massive with respect to the linear power spectrum.},

	abstract = {The energy scale of dark energy, ∼2×10−3 eV, is a long way off compared to all known fundamental scales—except for the neutrino masses. If dark energy is dynamical and couples to neutrinos, this is no longer a coincidence. The time at which dark energy starts to behave as an effective cosmological constant can be linked to the time at which the cosmic neutrinos become nonrelativistic. This naturally places the onset of the Universe’s accelerated expansion in recent cosmic history, addressing the why-now problem of dark energy. We show that these mechanisms indeed work in the growing neutrino quintessence model—even if the fully nonlinear structure formation and backreaction are taken into account, which were previously suspected of spoiling the cosmological evolution. The attractive force between neutrinos arising from their coupling to dark energy grows as large as 106 times the gravitational strength. This induces very rapid dynamics of neutrino fluctuations which are nonlinear at redshift z≈2. Nevertheless, a nonlinear stabilization phenomenon ensures only mildly nonlinear oscillating neutrino overdensities with a large-scale gravitational potential substantially smaller than that of cold dark matter perturbations. Depending on model parameters, the signals of large-scale neutrino lumps may render the cosmic neutrino background observable.},

In this case realistic models of dynamical dark energy exist which are testable by the observation or nonobservation of large neutrino lumps.},

	abstract = {Future galaxy surveys require one percent precision in the theoretical knowledge of the power spectrum over a large range including very nonlinear scales. While this level of accuracy is easily obtained in the linear regime with perturbation theory, it represents a serious
challenge for small scales where numerical simulations are required. In this paper we quantify the precision of present-day N-body methods, identifying main potential error sources from the set-up of initial conditions to the measurement of the final power spectrum. We directly compare three widely used N-body codes, Ramses, Pkdgrav3, and Gadget3 which represent three main discretisation techniques: the particle-mesh method, the tree method, and a hybrid combination of the two. For standard run parameters, the codes agree to within one percent at k{\textless}=1 h Mpc‑1 and to within three percent at k{\textless}=10
h Mpc‑1. We also consider the bispectrum and show that the reduced bispectra agree at the sub-percent level for k{\textless}= 2 h Mpc‑1. In a second step, we quantify potential errors due to initial conditions, box size, and resolution using an extended suite of simulations performed with our fastest code Pkdgrav3. We demonstrate that the simulation box size should not be smaller than L=0.5 h‑1Gpc to avoid systematic finite-volume effects (while much larger boxes are required to beat down the statistical sample variance). Furthermore, a maximum particle mass of
Mp=109 h‑1Msolar is
required to conservatively obtain one percent precision of the matter power spectrum. As a consequence, numerical simulations covering large survey volumes of upcoming missions such as DES, LSST, and Euclid will need more than a trillion particles to reproduce clustering properties at the targeted accuracy.},

	abstract = {We investigate the nonlinear power spectra of density perturbations and acoustic oscillations in growing neutrino quintessence. In this
scenario, the neutrino mass has a strong dependence on the quintessence field. The induced coupling stops the evolution of the field when the neutrinos become nonrelativistic, and triggers the transition to the accelerating phase of the cosmological expansion. For the calculation of the nonlinear spectra we employ the time renormalization group, which resums subsets of diagrams of arbitrarily high order in cosmological perturbation theory. At redshifts around five, the neutrino fluctuations are still linear and acoustic oscillations are present in the neutrino power spectrum, induced by the acoustic oscillations in the baryonic and dark-matter sectors. The neutrino perturbations become nonlinear at redshifts around three. The mode coupling generated by the
nonlinearities erases the oscillations in the neutrino spectrum at some redshift above two. There is a potential danger that at later times the influence of the gravitational potentials induced by the neutrino inhomogeneities could erase the oscillations from the baryonic and dark-matter spectra, making the scenario incompatible with observations. For the scenario to be viable, the neutrino-induced gravitational potentials in the range of baryon acoustic oscillations should not grow to average values much larger than 10-4. The magnitude of the expected potentials is still not known reliably, as the process of structure formation is poorly understood in growing neutrino
quintessence. The time renormalization group cannot describe the effects of nonlinear clustering. Alternative methods, such as hydrodynamic simulations, must be empoloyed for the calculation of the spectra at low redshifts.},

Finally, we present a Fisher forecast using the tomographic weak lensing from an Euclid-like experiment and we also consider the combination with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarisation spectra from a Planck-like mission.

	abstract = {A quintessence scalar field or cosmon interacting with neutrinos can have important effects on cosmological structure formation. Within growing neutrino models the coupling becomes effective only in recent times, when neutrinos become non-relativistic, stopping the evolution of the cosmon. This can explain why dark energy dominates the universe only in a rather recent epoch by relating the present dark energy density to the small mass of neutrinos. Such models predict the presence of stable neutrino lumps at supercluster scales ({\textasciitilde}200 Mpc and bigger), caused by an attractive force between neutrinos which is stronger than gravity and mediated by the cosmon. We present a method to follow the initial non-linear formation of neutrino lumps in physical space, by integrating numerically on a 3D grid non-linear evolution equations, until virialization naturally occurs. As a first application, we show results for cosmologies with final large neutrino average mass {\textasciitilde}2 eV: in this case, neutrino lumps indeed form and mimic very large cold dark matter structures, with a typical gravitational potential 10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\} for a lump size {\textasciitilde}10 Mpc, and reaching larger values for lumps of about 200 Mpc. A rough estimate of the cosmological gravitational potential at small k in the non-linear regime, Phi\_nu = 10{\textasciicircum}\{-6\} (k/k\_0){\textasciicircum}\{-2\}, 1.2x10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\} h/Mpc {\textless} k\_0 {\textless} 7.8x10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\} h/Mpc, turns out to be many orders of magnitude smaller than an extrapolation of the linear evolution of density fluctuations. The size of the neutrino-induced gravitational potential could modify the spectrum of CMB anisotropies for small angular momenta.},

In these models, dark energy and neutrinos are coupled such that the neutrino masses are functions of the scalar field playing the role of dark energy. We begin by describing the cosmological background evolution of such a system. It is pointed out that, similar to models with a dark matter/dark energy interaction, the apparent equation of state measured with SNIa can be smaller than -1. We then discuss the effect of mass-varying neutrinos on the CMB anisotropies and the matter power spectrum. A suppression of power in the CMB power spectrum at large angular scales is usually observed. We give an explanation for this behaviour and discuss different couplings and quintessence potentials to show the generality of the results obtained. We perform a likelihood analysis using wide-ranging SNIa, CMB and LSS observations to assess whether such theories are viable. Treating the neutrino mass as a free parameter we find that the constraints on the coupling are weak, since CMB and LSS surveys give only upper bounds on the neutrino mass. However, fixing a priori the neutrino masses, we find that there is some evidence that the existence of such a coupling is actually preferred by current cosmological data over the standard LambdaCDM cosmology.},

This enables dark energy to form from any potential, regardless of its shape. The field's equation of state mimicks that of a cosmological constant. We present a physically motivated realisation in the form of a derivative neutrino-majoron coupling. Coherent motions, which form only once the neutrinos become non-relativistic, could be responsible for instigating the freezing process.

We derive a model independent relation between the neutrino mass and the equation of state parameter of the neutrino dark energy, which is applicable for general theories of mass varying particles. The neutrino mass depends on the local neutrino density and the observed neutrino mass can exceed the cosmological bound on a constant neutrino mass. We discuss microscopic realizations of the MaVaN acceleration scenario, which involve a sterile neutrino. We consider naturalness constraints for mass varying particles, and find that both ev cutoffs and ev mass particles are needed to avoid fine-tuning. These considerations give a (current) mass of order an eV for the sterile neutrino in microscopic realizations, which could be detectable at MiniBooNE. Because the sterile neutrino was much heavier at earlier times, constraints from big bang nucleosynthesis on additional states are not problematic. We consider regions of high neutrino density and find that the most likely place today to find neutrino masses which are significantly different from the neutrino masses in our solar system is in a supernova. The possibility of different neutrino mass in different regions of the galaxy and the local group could be significant for Z-burst models of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.

One might expect that in multiple-neutrino models, the lighter species could continue to act as a source for the acceleron, generating dark energy without the help of heavier species. This paper shows that by considering the evolution of the acceleron field for a large class of models, the result of any neutrino component becoming unstable is that all components become unstable within a short time on cosmological scales.

	abstract = {We present a new massively parallel code for N-body and cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of modified gravity models. The code employs a multigrid-accelerated Newton–Gauss–Seidel relaxation solver on an adaptive mesh to efficiently solve for perturbations in the scalar degree of freedom of the modified gravity model. As this new algorithm is implemented as a module for the p-gadget3 code, it can at the same time follow the baryonic physics included in p-gadget3, such as hydrodynamics, radiative cooling and star formation. We demonstrate that the code works reliably by applying it to simple test problems that can be solved analytically, as well as by comparing cosmological simulations to results from the literature. Using the new code, we perform the first non-radiative and radiative cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of an f (R)-gravity model. We also discuss the impact of active galactic nucleus feedback on the matter power spectrum, as well as degeneracies between the influence of baryonic processes and modifications of gravity.},

	abstract = {We study Quintessence cosmologies in the context of scalar-tensor theories of gravity, where a scalar field \${\textbackslash}phi\$, assumed to provide most of the cosmic energy density today, is non-minimally coupled to the Ricci curvature scalar \$R\$. Such `Extended Quintessence' cosmologies have the appealing feature that the same field causing the time (and space) variation of the cosmological constant is the source of a varying Newton's constant {\textbackslash}`a la Jordan-Brans-Dicke. We investigate here two classes of models, where the gravitational sector of the Lagrangian is \$F({\textbackslash}phi)R\$ with \$F({\textbackslash}phi )={\textbackslash}xi{\textbackslash}phi{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ (Induced Gravity, IG) and \$F({\textbackslash}phi)=1+{\textbackslash}xi{\textbackslash}phi{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ (Non-Minimal Coupling, NMC). As a first application of this idea we consider a specific model, where the Quintessence field, \${\textbackslash}phi\$, obeying the simplest inverse power potential, has \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}phi\}=0.6\$ today, in the context of the Cold Dark Matter scenario, with scale-invariant adiabatic initial perturbations. We find that, if \${\textbackslash}xi{\textbackslash}lesssim 5{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$ for IG and \${\textbackslash}xi{\textbackslash}lesssim 5{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}({\textbackslash}sqrt\{G\}{\textbackslash}phi\_\{0\}){\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ for NMC (\${\textbackslash}phi\_\{0\}\$ is the present Quintessence value) our Quintessence field satisfies the existing solar system experimental constraints. Using linear perturbation theory we then obtain the polarization and temperature anisotropy spectra of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) as well as the matter power-spectrum. The perturbation behavior possesses distinctive features, that we name `QR-effects', regarding acoustic peak location and height, late time integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, as well as turnover and amplitude in the matter power spectrum. These features could be detected in the upcoming observations on CMB and large-scale structure.},
